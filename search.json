Topics include installing, configuring, and uninstalling hardware devices and device drivers, installing and uninstalling system and application software, backing up and restoring software, hard disk partitioning and formatting, help desk, user training.\n\n\nWhat topics does this course cover?\n\nComputer Hardware – what computers are made of\nComputer logic – how do we make computers behave predictably and controllably?\nComputer Software – what kind of programs can we make computers run?\nHelpdesk and Troubleshooting computers – as a hobby and a profession\nOperating systems – the most important software for a computer to run\nIntro to Servers and Networking – how computers communicate with eachother\n\nEach topic above is a massive field of research and industry in its own right – you could get a PhD in each! We will be introduced to each briefly, and at a high level (overview) to come away with a better technical understanding than we had before.",

    "text": "Rules for success in this class\n\nRule 1: Attend all classes and labs!\nI will freely provide my slides and as many course resources as necessary to supplement this class.\nBut! My course notes are not a substitute for regular class attendance. Hands on experience is key!\nNote: All of your marks come from Assignments and Tests. We will do in-class activities that are neither Assignments or Tests, but are required – completing the in-class labs will be a component of your Assignment mark. If you finish in-class labs quickly, you will have more time to work on Assignments in class, instead of at home.\n\n\nRule 2: Consult the Support Material\n\nClass Slides\nLab and exercises in class\nAssignments\nYour class notes\n\n\n\nRule 3: Use a calendar to track all your deadlines\n\nTo stay on track for all your deadlines, try to plan one or two weeks ahead!\nComplete your assignments on time\n\nBut! Endeavour to at least hand in assignments. Better late/incomplete than never.\n\nIf you miss a deadline, please don’t ignore it!\n\nMIO me. I’m here to help! And that includes for late/incomplete assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRule 4: Reach out for help!\n\nReach out to me if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed\nTry your best to get to know other students\n\nHelp each other out! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother than you will from listening to me\nLearning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school\n\nSeek out help if you are struggling (from me, from peers, from John Abbott student services, etc.)\n\n\n\nRule 5: Be curious!\nThis field has a lot of support online. Stay curious, the internet is your Oyster!",
