    "text": "Personal vs shared computing: What is a server?\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on UnsplashThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms."

For instance, I use one for playing NES Tetris!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma Monitors\n\nPlasma\n\nTiny cells of ionized gas that light up when stimulated by electricity.\nOften used in home theatre applications due to accurate video representation.\nHigh levels of brightness, deep black levels and very wide color range.\nHave shorter life span, susceptible to “screen burn-in” (this is why screensavers are called “screen savers”! Same for CRT).\n\n(+) Plasma cell will produce light that looks good from every angle, it was high refresh rate (videos are smoother)\n(-) BUT! Consumes a lot of electricity\n(-) Doesn’t work at high altitudes! (low pressure)\n\n\nPlasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge). Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)\n\n\nLCD Monitors\n\n\nLCD (Liquid crystal display)\n\nCommonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.\nConsists of a white backlight (in light, white = all color’s combined), two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution between them to transform the backlight into a coherent pixel grid.\nAn electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.\n\n(+) Allows to have flat screens!\n\n\nFor more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx-JVoOFYhs&ab_channel=e-learning%C3%A9lectronique\n\nAn LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass (2), liquid crystal (5um), metal and dielectrics Liquid cystal is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion) Liquid crytsal is organic (made of carbone and oxygen), they can be smectic (parallel), nematic (same direction not layered), cholesteric (helix order) LCD TN (Twistic nematic) cheapest The polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through. To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face ( made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green)\n\n\nLED (Light emitting diode)\n\nSame as LCD but uses LED backlighting  instead of a white backlight with crystal liquid to light the display.\nThe brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel\n(+) Thinner (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast\n(+) Lower power  consumption.\n\n\n\nFor more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96QwqOZ4xjE&ab_channel=Lesics\n\nOLED (Organic LED)\n\nSimilar to LED, but no backlighting  required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied .\n(+)Allows for perfect representation of dark colors  unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors\n(-)More expensive to produce, more susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)\n\n\n\nFor more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAMhX3Drq14&ab_channel=Lesics\n\nDLP (Digital light processing)\n\nUsed in projectors.\nSpinning color wheel with microprocessor-controlled array of mirrors.\nEach mirror corresponds to a specific pixel, reflecting light.\nMonochrome image is created using up to 1024 shades of grey.\nColor wheel then adds to complete the projected image.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinters\n\nPrinters take data from a computer and generate output on paper.\n\nBasic principles\n\nSimilar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)\nRather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper. The physical setup is different, but the same principles are at work.\n\n\n\n\nA high enough quantity of toasted bread produces the qualitative impression of a human eye in this “piece” of art. Printers (and monitors) use much higher quantities of “pixels” than depicted here!\n\nInkjet Printers\nUses tiny droplets of ink to produce images.\nUses cyan, magenta and blue instead of RGB like screens!\nHeat is applied to an ink reservoir, which pushes ink bubbles through a nozzle in a controlled manner.\nThe ink liquid droplets are smaller in diameter than a human hair! Many of these added together produce the quality of a coherent image.\n\n\nLaser Printers\n\n\nExpensive when they were initially introduced.\nProduce high-quality output quietly at a high speed.\nProduces images by directing a laser beam  at a mirror which bounces the beam onto a drum.\n\nThe drum contains a special coating  to which the toner (ink powder) sticks.\nA laser beam then conveys information to the drum, neutralizing and detaching some toner.\nAs the paper rolls by the drum, the toner is transferred onto the paper. A hot roller then bonds toner to the paper.",

    "text": "Rules for success in this class\n\nRule 1: Attend all classes and labs!\nI will freely provide my slides and as many course resources as necessary to supplement this class.\nBut! My course notes are not a substitute for regular class attendance. Hands on experience is key!\nNote: All of your marks come from Assignments and Tests. We will do in-class activities that are neither Assignments or Tests, but are required – completing the in-class labs will be a component of your Assignment mark. If you finish in-class labs quickly, you will have more time to work on Assignments in class, instead of at home.\n\n\nRule 2: Consult the Support Material\n\nClass Slides\nLab and exercises in class\nAssignments\nYour class notes\n\n\n\nRule 3: Use a calendar to track all your deadlines\n\nTo stay on track for all your deadlines, try to plan one or two weeks ahead!\nComplete your assignments on time\n\nBut! Endeavour to at least hand in assignments. Better late/incomplete than never.\n\nIf you miss a deadline, please don’t ignore it!\n\nMIO me. I’m here to help! And that includes for late/incomplete assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRule 4: Reach out for help!\n\nReach out to me if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed\nTry your best to get to know other students\n\nHelp each other out! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother than you will from listening to me\nLearning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school\n\nSeek out help if you are struggling (from me, from peers, from John Abbott student services, etc.)\n\n\n\nRule 5: Be curious!\nThis field has a lot of support online. Stay curious, the internet is your Oyster!",
