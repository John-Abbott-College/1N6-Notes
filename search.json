You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother.\nLearning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school\n\nIf you feel more advanced or have already done what’s shown in class, don’t hesitate to help others and share your knowledge with the class.\nSeek out help if you are struggling (from me, from peers, from John Abbott student services, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n5: Be curious!\nThis field has a lot of support online. Stay curious, the internet is your Oyster!"

    "text": "CPU Analogy: Guy in a Box\nLet’s start with an analogy: CPUs are a “Guy-in-a-box”. This guy:\n\ncan perform any mathematical function quickly.\nlives in a closed-up box so direct communication is impossible.\n\nLet’s say have 16 light bulbs: 8 for the guy, and 8 for us.\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\nThe light bulbs:\n\ncan be controlled (turned on or off) by us and by the guy-in-the-box\nAre synchronized (bulb 1 for us has the same value as bulb 1 for the guy)\n\nWe can share messages by setting the light bulbs on/off, as long as we:\n\nAgree on schedule (not changing the lightbulbs at the same time)\nAgree on meaning (share the same interpretation of lightbulb being on/off)\n\nThis arrangement is called a data bus: a method for transporting data from one component to another using electrical circuits\n\n\n\nRegisters\nSo far, we can send/receive “messages” from the light bulbs. But, in order to “remember” a message, the guy needs at least a few workstations ( registers ) to copy our messages, otherwise the messages will be lost every time the data bus updates.\n\nRegisters are places to store a very small amount of data temporarily\nRegisters are usually the around the 1-4x the size of the data bus\nWe can give the registers names to distinguish them (AX, BX, CX, DX for example)\n\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\nCodebook: Agreeing on meaning\nIt’s important to have common definitions for the meaning of the lightbulbs being on/off to understand messages sent by this method\nCPUs are designed with a codebook  (instruction set) that defines the commands that we can give to the guy in the box\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\nClock: Agreeing on schedule\nNow we are ready to communicate with the guy in the boxWe can send them the first command by lighting up the bulbs on the data bus.\nBut how do they know when we have finished setting up the light bulbs?\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a bell activated by a button.\nA real computer uses a special wire called the clock wire (CLK). The CLK wire is turned on and off on a precise and regular schedule. This is called a clock cycle.\nEach time the clock turns on, the state of our lightbulbs is shared with the guy in the box\nThe guy then has until the clock turns off to send a message back\nThe next time the clock turns on, a new message is sent to the CPU\nThe time between each clock cycle is the speed that a CPU can perform a given task\nThe maximum number of clock cycles a CPU can handle in given period of time is called the clock speed.\n\n\n\nSample Guy in a Box Problem\nUsing the following codebook, ask the “Guy in a box” to calculate 2+3\nYou must send a series of commandsto the CPU. The CPU will act on each command and give you an answer.\nYour answer should be a sequence of numbers you could send to the guy in the box to get the right answer.\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n10000000  The next line is a number, put it in AX\n00000010  The number 2\n10010000  The next line is a number, put it in BX\n00000011  The number 3\n10110000  Add AX to BX and put the result in AX\n11000000  Place the value of AX on the external data bus\nA set of commands such as this is called a program. A program is a series of command sent to a CPU in a specific order for the CPU to perform work.",

    "text": "CPU Properties\nThe most important properties that define CPU behavior are speed and bus width: that is, how fast the clock cycle repeats, and how much data per clock cycle the CPU can process.\nClock Speed\nWe measure CPU speed : in cycles per second, e.g. megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).\n\nUnit of Measurement:  Hertz, usually written as Hz, denote frequency. 1Hz is “one time per second”, 10Hz is “ten times per second”.\n\nWe can use SI Prefixes  (International System of Unit Prefixes) to compare magnitudes easily.\nYou will see many of these in computer science over and over again – get to know them well!\n\nSI Prefixes for Frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit\nMeaning\nDefinition\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nHz\nOnce per second\n1/s, or 1Hz\n1-2Hz: human heart-rate at rest (1Hz = 60 beats per minute, 2Hz = 120 bpm)24Hz: framerate of historic cinema20-60Hz: frequency range for bass notes (C0 = 16.35Hz to C2 = 65.4Hz)60-144Hz: framerate of most monitors\n\n\nkHz\nThousand times per second\n1000 Hz\n0.1-2kHz: frequency range for midrange notes (A2=0.110kHz, C7=2kHz)20kHz: maximum frequency audible to human ear740 kHz: Intel 4004 processor clock speed (1971)\n\n\nMHz\nMillion times per second\n1000000 Hz\n8MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 70s35MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 80s500-1000MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 90s)\n\n\nGHz\nBillion times per second\n1000000000 Hz\n2-5GHz: Almost all consumer CPUs in 2024 have base clock speeds in this range9.117 GHz: fastest CPU clock speed ever recorded (2024)\n\n\n\nBus width\nThe amount of data processed at a time depends on the “number of lightbulbs” or the width of the data bus\nBus width  is measured in bits, e.g. 8-bits, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.\nQuestion: how many bits do you need in bus width to represent the Guy in the Box and their codebook from the previous problems?"

Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card.

The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots.

Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers within computers?\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.\n\n\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).1\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction.2\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.\n\n\nHardware: The physical components that make up a computer system.\nSoftware: The programs (instructions) that tell the computer (the hardware) what to do.\n\n\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.\n\n\nNone for this lecture – stay tuned for the next two lectures!\n\n\nThe following questions invite you to reflect on the key information learned in this lesson. If you can’t answer the question, you can click the corresponding link to review the topic more closely. Future assignments and tests may be based on questions like these:\n\nWhat are the two main properites of computers?\nAre video game consoles computers?\nAre there examples of nonelectonic computers?

    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card.

The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots. Image by Pearson Scott Foresman, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntikythera mechanism fragment, dated to 80 BCE. Thought to have been part of a complex system of dozens of wheels and plates, designed by engineers to measure time based on movements of the sun, moon, and other stars and planets known at the time. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine diagram. A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers within computers?\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense.

    "text": "Output Devices\nOutput Devices are devices that present data and information to the user from a computer.\n\nMonitors\nThere are many different types of monitors use different technologies to create an image. However, the common principles are the same:\n\nDigital representation of image to display is sent to the monitor\nThe monitor produces each pixel (the “atom” of monitor displays) using some deterministic physical technology\nLight from the monitor reaches us as a useful/pleasing image.\n\nThe following sections are the main technologies used today (from oldest to newest)\n\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT)\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors are very complicated, very cool, moderately dangerous, and mostly obsolete!\n\nThe most common type of consumer and industry television before ~2010\nBasically: a tungsten coil is heated in a vacuum until it sheds electrons, those electrons are accelerated by an electric field and guided by magnets to hit a phosphor coated glass display to emit light in a pixel grid\nObsolete since today their are lighter, simpler higher resolution technologies\nStill used today for some applications due to zero latency . For instance, I use one for playing NES Tetris!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma\nPlasma monitors use tiny cells of ionised gas that light up when stimulated by electricity.\n\nOften used in home theatre applications due to accurate video representation.\nHigh levels of brightness, deep black levels and very wide colour range.\nHave shorter life span, susceptible to “screen burn-in” (this is why screensavers are called “screen savers”! Same for CRT).\n(+) Plasma cell will produce light that looks good from every angle, it was high refresh rate (videos are smoother)\n(-) BUT! Consumes a lot of electricity\n(-) Doesn’t work at high altitudes! (low pressure)\n\n\n\n\nPlasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge). Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)\n\n\n\n\nLiquid Crystal Display (LCD)\nAn LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. Liquid cystal is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion). This technology allows for precise control of color without the need to ionise gas with powerful electronics.\n\nCommonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.\nConsists of a white backlight (in light, white = all colours combined), two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution between them to transform the backlight into a coherent pixel grid.\nAn electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.\n(+) Allow the use of flat screens!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through. To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face ( made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green)\n\n\n\n\nLight emitting diode (LED)\n\nAn LCD display that uses LED backlighting instead of a white backlight to light the display. The brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel\n(+) Thinner (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast\n(+) Lower power  consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\nFor more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx-JVoOFYhs&ab_channel=e-learning%C3%A9lectronique\n\n\nOrganic LED (OLED)\nOLED displays are similar to LED, but no backlighting required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied.\n\nSimilar to LED, but no backlighting  required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied .\n(+) Allows for perfect representation of dark colors  unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors\n(-) More expensive to produce, more susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)\n\nHere’s a great video (8 mins) explaining both physical and software technologies required to make the above monitors work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyLDA9QT8EY\nWith LCD, LED, and OLED, we finally get to the most modern monitor technologies. These are used in our labs, most computers, laptops. They’re ordered here approximately in order of lowest (LCD) -&gt; highest (OLED) quality, though pros and cons exist for each.\nSee here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays.\n\n\n\n\nPrinters\nPrinters take data from a computer and generate output on paper: Basic principles\n\nSimilar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)\nRather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper. The physical setup is different, but the same principles are at work.\n\n\n\n\nA high enough quantity of toasted bread produces the qualitative impression of a human eye in this “piece” of art. Printers (and monitors) use much higher quantities of “pixels” than depicted here!\n\n\n\nDot-matrix printers\n\nUses print heads containing pins which produce patterns of dots on the paper by mechanical impact (pressing).\nInexpensive and typically print at a speed of 100 - 600 characters per second.\n(Optional) See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer for more detail on history and technology\nWhile still in use for particular applications (printing receipts for e.g.), these are now obsoleted by…\n\n\n\nInk-jet printers\n\nUses tiny droplets of ink to produce images.\nHeat is applied to an ink reservoir, which pushes ink bubbles through a nozzle in a controlled manner.\nThe ink liquid droplets are smaller in diameter than a human hair! Many of these added together produce the quality of a coherent image.\nQuieter than dot-matrix, and also provide better speed and higher quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk-based color printer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk jet cartridge operation. Image source: youtube.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser Printers\n\nExpensive when they were initially introduced.\nProduce high-quality output quietly at a high speed.\nProduces images by directing a laser beam at a mirror which bounces the beam onto a drum.\n\nThe drum contains a special coating to which the toner (ink powder) sticks.\nA laser beam then conveys information to the drum, neutralizing and detaching some toner.\nAs the paper rolls by the drum, the toner is transferred onto the paper. A hot roller then bonds toner to the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.",

    "text": "Connectors\nConnectors are how to get the computer to talk to all these output devices!\n\nCables\nSome technical terms:\n\nCable (electric) : The insulated copper wire that carries electrical/digital signals from devices to/from computers\nCable (optical) : The insulated glass tube that carries digital signals in the form of light between devices and computers\nPort : The slot where the insertable end of USB cable is connected to the computer\n“Male” / “Female” cable ends : Distinguishing between the insertable end and the receptacle end for cables\nConverter : A device that allows different standards/types of connectors to be used together\n\n\nElectrical cables\ntransmit an electrical signal on a conducting wire, insulated to protect the signal/surroundings\n\n\n\nOptical cables\ntransmit signal in the form of light. Very fast! (speed of light in glass).\n\nA short paper (5 pages) comparing the two cable technologies in more detail: Fibre Optics vs Copper Cabling: Understanding the Differences\n\n\n\nUSB\nUniversal Serial Bus (we’ll talk about the meaning of the last two words soon!) is used to connect most modern devices to computers. Back in the day, mice/keyboards/external storage/speakers/etc. all had different cables. These have now been (mostly) unified under the USB standard.\nUSB connectors can transmit both power (e.g. charging phones) and information (data). Despite being “Universal” there are an incredible number of USB types.\n\nUSB “Number” standards refer to the transmission speed and power of the cables\n\ne.g. USB 3 is faster/more power than USB 2 and USB 2\n\nUSB “Letter” standards refer to the physical design of the connector and the port\n\ne.g. USB C and USB A are incompatible interfaces, cannot be interchanged.\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer standards are backwards compatible (e.g. USB 3.1 cable works in USB 1.1 port at USB 1.1 speed/power)\n\n\n\n\nAudio\nMost commonly the standard headphone jack (TSR connector). Available in several sizes, most commonly 3.5mm or ⅛” mini audio jack. Can be color coded - microphone (pink), speaker (green).\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\nFor higher-end audio, we can use fiberoptic cables as these can transmit larger amounts of data more quickly, which is required for producing a high-quality audio signal.\n\n\nVideo\nVGA cable is commonly used for computer monitors (15-pins). Low resolutions, now obsolete. There exist converter cables to connect VGA monitors to newer computers.\nMiniVGA is a variant found on laptops.\nDVI was once the common modern upgrade from VGA, capable of higher resolutions. MiniDVI and MicroDVI on “thin” laptops.\nS-Video commonly used for DVD players, camcorders and older consoles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVGA, DVI, and RCA cables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDVI. Can be distinguished from VGA by noticing that it is a much wider interface with many more pins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS-video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converter from mini-DP to three possible outputs: DP, DVI, and HDMI\n\n\n\n\n\nRCA cables include composite video (yellow) and stereo audio cables (red for right; white/black for left). Component video offers a better picture.\nHDMI is the new standard for audio and video transmission in a single cable.\nDisplayPort (and Mini DisplayPort) more commonly used in computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\neSATA is used internally to connect the hard drive to the motherboard but can also be used for portable hard drives.\n\n\n\nNetworking\nTelephone cable (RJ11) used for connecting to the internet through DSL/ADSL modems. Standard phone cable has 4 wires; connector has 4 pins. Clip helps to maintain tight connection.\nEthernet (RJ45) is the standard for wired networking. Based on Cat5 twisted pair cable, made from 8 individual wires. Connector looks similar to phone plug but is thicker and wider. Also uses a clip to maintain tight connection.",
