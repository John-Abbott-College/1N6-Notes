    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card. Images by aerozol from Pixabay. :::\n\nNonelectronics?\nEven before there were consumer electronics, there were devices made to store and process data – that is, computers! The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots. Image by Pearson Scott Foresman, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntikythera mechanism fragment, dated to 80 BCE. Thought to have been part of a complex system of dozens of wheels and plates, designed by engineers to measure time based on movements of the sun, moon, and other stars and planets known at the time. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine diagram. A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers within computers?\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.\n\n\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).1\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction.2\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.\n\n\nHardware: The physical components that make up a computer system.\nSoftware: The programs (instructions) that tell the computer (the hardware) what to do.\n\n\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.\n\n\nNone for this lecture – stay tuned for the next two lectures!\n\n\nThe following questions invite you to reflect on the key information learned in this lesson. If you can’t answer the question, you can click the corresponding link to review the topic more closely. Future assignments and tests may be based on questions like these:\n\nWhat are the two main properites of computers?\nAre video game consoles computers?\nAre there examples of nonelectonic computers? How do nonelectronic computer compute?\nWhy is binary relevant to computers?\nWhat is the property of computers that means they reliably behave the same way given the same input?\nWhat is the name for the type of computer that is always on, and is specialized for processing large amounts of data and pooling many computing resources in one place?\n\n\n\nThis section contains helpful links to related content. You aren’t required to study these in detail, but it never hurts to learn more.\n\nComputer Basics by GCF Global: We will eventually cover almost all of the material in this free online resource; for now, Parts 1-7 in particular are relevant to what we have learned so far.\n“The Mother of All Demos” This is a 1968 presentation that introduced many of the hardware/graphics concepts we will see today and some we will see in future lectures: the mouse, networking, video conferencing, word documents, hyperlinks, gamer headphones, etc. It is very cool to see the palpable excitement of the 2000+ audience tuning into a passionate presentation of a series of completely new technologies.\nMontréal’s Musée de l’Ordinateur – unfortunately the physical location has been closed since 2022, but the website is still a neat resource for reading on the history of personal computers and their evolution. The author’s bias towards Bill Gates and Windows machines is quite strong (there is much more to the story), but the information provided is reliable and interesting.",

    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card.

The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots.

A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers within computers?\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.\n\n\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).1\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction.2\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.\n\n\nHardware: The physical components that make up a computer system.\nSoftware: The programs (instructions) that tell the computer (the hardware) what to do.\n\n\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.\n\n\nNone for this lecture – stay tuned for the next two lectures!\n\n\nThe following questions invite you to reflect on the key information learned in this lesson. If you can’t answer the question, you can click the corresponding link to review the topic more closely. Future assignments and tests may be based on questions like these:\n\nWhat are the two main properites of computers?\nAre video game consoles computers?\nAre there examples of nonelectonic computers? How do nonelectronic computer compute?\nWhy is binary relevant to computers?\nWhat is the property of computers that means they reliably behave the same way given the same input?\nWhat is the name for the type of computer that is always on, and is specialized for processing large amounts of data and pooling many computing resources in one place?\n\n\n\nThis section contains helpful links to related content. You aren’t required to study these in detail, but it never hurts to learn more.\n\nComputer Basics by GCF Global: We will eventually cover almost all of the material in this free online resource; for now, Parts 1-7 in particular are relevant to what we have learned so far.\n“The Mother of All Demos” This is a 1968 presentation that introduced many of the hardware/graphics concepts we will see today and some we will see in future lectures: the mouse, networking, video conferencing, word documents, hyperlinks, gamer headphones, etc. It is very cool to see the palpable excitement of the 2000+ audience tuning into a passionate presentation of a series of completely new technologies.\nMontréal’s Musée de l’Ordinateur – unfortunately the physical location has been closed since 2022, but the website is still a neat resource for reading on the history of personal computers and their evolution. The author’s bias towards Bill Gates and Windows machines is quite strong (there is much more to the story), but the information provided is reliable and interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese digital states are made possible using electrical circuitry. In order to do complex operations with these states, we can use the binary numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters, and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)For one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you don’t). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices reliably and predictably produce the same deterministic results under the same physical conditions."

    "text": "CPU Analogy: Guy in a Box 📦\nLet’s start with an analogy: CPUs are a “Guy-in-a-box”. This guy:\n\ncan perform any mathematical function quickly.\nlives in a closed-up box so direct communication is impossible.\n\nOur only way of communicating with this guy is via the External Data Bus. This is 16 light bulbs: 8 visible inside the box, and 8 visible outside the box. There is a light switch for each pair (inside-outside) the box which allows us to flip both the inside and outside bulbs and hence send binary messages!\n\n\n\nA man in a box analogy. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\nData bus 💡💡💡\nIn this analogy this arrangement of light bulbs is called a data bus: a method for transporting data from one component to another using electrical circuits. These “light bulbs”: - can be controlled (turned on or off) by us and by the guy-in-the-box - are synchronized (bulb 1 for us has the same value as bulb 1 for the guy) - we can share messages by setting the light bulbs on off, as long as we: agree on schedule (not changing the lightbulbs at the same time) - the meaning (share the same interpretation of lightbulb being on/off)\n\n\n\nCodebook: Agreeing on meaning 📖\nHow do we share the same meaning?\nIt’s important to have common definitions for the meaning of the lightbulbs being on/off to understand messages sent by this method CPUs are designed with a codebook (instruction set) that defines the commands that we can give to the guy in the box. This codebook is built into each CPU by its manufacturer and is called “machine code”.\n\n\n\nEvery pair of light bulbs is matching and can be controlled from the inside by the CPU or from the outside by the program executing instructions on the CPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf CPUs only understand machine code (sequence of 1 or 0), how can this C# code be understood by it?\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\"); \n\n\n\n\n\nRegisters\nSo far, we can send/receive “messages” from the light bulbs. But, in order to “remember” a message, the guy needs at least a few workstations ( registers ) to copy our messages, otherwise the messages will be lost every time the data bus updates.\n\nRegisters are places to store a very small amount of data temporarily\nRegisters are usually the around the 1-4x the size of the data bus\nWe can give the registers names to distinguish them (AX, BX, CX, DX for example)\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy of the registers acting as workstations. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAre CPU registers made of the same technology as RAM?\n\n\n\n\n\nClock: Agreeing on schedule ⏰\nNow we are ready to communicate with the guy in the box. We can send them the first command by lighting up the bulbs on the data bus.\nBut how do they know when we have finished setting up the light bulbs?\n\n\n\nClock analogy. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\nWe can use a bell activated by a button.\nA real computer uses a special wire called the clock wire (CLK). The CLK wire is turned on and off on a precise and regular schedule. This is called a clock cycle.\nEach time the clock turns on, the state of our lightbulbs is shared with the guy in the box\nThe guy then has until the clock turns off to send a message back\nThe next time the clock turns on, a new message is sent to the CPU\nThe time between each clock cycle is the speed that a CPU can perform a given task\nThe maximum number of clock cycles a CPU can handle in given period of time is called the clock speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n\n# Sample Guy in a Box Problem\n\n\nUsing the following codebook, ask the “Guy in a box” to calculate 2+3\n\n\nYou must send a series of commandsto the CPU. The CPU will act on each command and give you an answer.\n\n\nYour answer should be a sequence of numbers you could send to the guy in the box to get the right answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n10000000  The next line is a number, put it in AX\n00000010  The number 2\n10010000  The next line is a number, put it in BX\n00000011  The number 3\n10110000  Add AX to BX and put the result in AX\n11000000  Place the value of AX on the external data bus\nA set of commands such as this is called a program. A program is a series of command sent to a CPU in a specific order for the CPU to perform work.\n:::",

    "text": "CPU Properties 📊\nThe most important properties that define CPU behavior are speed and bus width: that is, how fast the clock cycle repeats, and how much data per clock cycle the CPU can process.\n\nClock Speed\nWe measure CPU speed : in cycles per second, e.g. megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUnit of Measurement\n\n\n\nHertz, usually written as Hz, denote frequency. 1Hz is “one time per second”, 10Hz is “ten times per second”. We can use SI Prefixes (International System of Unit Prefixes) to compare magnitudes easily.\nYou will see many of these in computer science over and over again – get to know them well!\n\nSI Prefixes for Frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit\nMeaning\nDefinition\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nHz\nOnce per second\n1/s, or 1Hz\n1-2Hz: human heart-rate at rest (1Hz = 60 beats per minute, 2Hz = 120 bpm)24Hz: framerate of historic cinema20-60Hz: frequency range for bass notes (C0 = 16.35Hz to C2 = 65.4Hz)60-144Hz: framerate of most monitors\n\n\nkHz\nThousand times per second\n1000 Hz\n0.1-2kHz: frequency range for midrange notes (A2=0.110kHz, C7=2kHz)20kHz: maximum frequency audible to human ear740 kHz: Intel 4004 processor clock speed (1971)\n\n\nMHz\nMillion times per second\n1000000 Hz\n8MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 70s35MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 80s500-1000MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 90s)\n\n\nGHz\nBillion times per second\n1000000000 Hz\n2-5GHz: Almost all consumer CPUs in 2024 have base clock speeds in this range9.117 GHz: fastest CPU clock speed ever recorded (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU Cores\nA multi-core SPU means that more than one CPU core is integrated into a single chip, each capable of running parallel processes. This means, in theory, that we multiply the amount of information that can be processes, send and recieved from/to the RAM.\nBenefits of Multi-core processors: - Enhancing the multitasking: multiple jobs done at the same time. - Improved performance: Faster and smoother performance. - Energy efficiency: More work can be done with less power.\n\nCPU Threads\nCPU cores and threads are closely related but not the same. A core is a physical unit within the CPU that executes instructions, while a thread is a virtual sequence of instructions assigned to a core. Think of cores as workers and threads as the jobs they carry out.\n&gt; When CPU has 16 threads, it simply means it can run 16 threads simultaneously.\n\n\n\nBus width\nThe amount of data processed at a time depends on the “number of lightbulbs” or the width of the data bus\nBus width is measured in bits, e.g. 8-bits, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuestion\n\n\n\nHow many bits do you need in bus width to represent the Guy in the Box and their codebook from the previous problems?\n\n\n\nIn actual computers, the CPU receives instructions ,addresses memory , and data on separate buses.\nThis allows the CPU to send AND receive the following information at the same time:\n\nControl Bus: What command to perform\nAddress Bus: Where in memory the result should be stored\nData Bus: What data to use to perform the command\n\n —\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe CPU is constantly talking to the RAM and the hardware components. At every clock interval, new instructions are sent through the control bus. Here are a few common instructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstruction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLOAD\nLoad this value from RAM\n\n\nADD\nAdd these two numbers\n\n\nSTORE\nSave this value to RAM\n\n\nCOMPARE\nCompare these two numbers\n\n\nJUMP IF\nIf a condition is true, jump to this next set of instructions (example : if statement)\n\n\nJUMP\nJump to this next set of instructions (without any conditions - example function call)\n\n\nIN\nRead data from the input device (example keyboard)\n\n\nOUT\nSend data to an output device (example printer)\n\n\n\nAll this information, the instruction, the location of the hardware devices are all in binary (machine code)! When you write a program in C#, Java, Python, etc. You are programming in high level programming language that will be compiled into machine code by the compiler of this language (or interpreted by the interpreter of this language).\n\n\n\nIllustration of CPU wiring to the RAM. Image source: Figure from In One Lesson on Youtube (excellent video explaination on CPUs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighway analogy: clock Speed vs bus width\n\nYou can double check that you understand a scientific concept by checking what units of measurement that concept is measured by:\nHighway\n\nNumber of lanes: (a number)\nSpeed limit: (unit distance per time elapsed, e.g. km/h)\n\nSystem bus\n\nBus width:  (a number of bits, eg a 32-bit processor)\nBus speed:  (unit information per time elapsed, e.g. bits/second)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy of the highway.

We can use SI Prefixes (International System of Unit Prefixes) to compare magnitudes easily.\nYou will see many of these in computer science over and over again – get to know them well!\n\nSI Prefixes for Frequencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit\nMeaning\nDefinition\nExamples\n\n\n\n\nHz\nOnce per second\n1/s, or 1Hz\n1-2Hz: human heart-rate at rest (1Hz = 60 beats per minute, 2Hz = 120 bpm)24Hz: framerate of historic cinema20-60Hz: frequency range for bass notes (C0 = 16.35Hz to C2 = 65.4Hz)60-144Hz: framerate of most monitors\n\n\nkHz\nThousand times per second\n1000 Hz\n0.1-2kHz: frequency range for midrange notes (A2=0.110kHz, C7=2kHz)20kHz: maximum frequency audible to human ear740 kHz: Intel 4004 processor clock speed (1971)\n\n\nMHz\nMillion times per second\n1000000 Hz\n8MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 70s35MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 80s500-1000MHz: fastest CPU clock speed in the 90s)\n\n\nGHz\nBillion times per second\n1000000000 Hz\n2-5GHz: Almost all consumer CPUs in 2024 have base clock speeds in this range9.117 GHz: fastest CPU clock speed ever recorded (2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU Cores\nA multi-core SPU means that more than one CPU core is integrated into a single chip, each capable of running parallel processes. This means, in theory, that we multiply the amount of information that can be processes, send and recieved from/to the RAM.\nBenefits of Multi-core processors: - Enhancing the multitasking: multiple jobs done at the same time. - Improved performance: Faster and smoother performance. - Energy efficiency: More work can be done with less power.\nCPU Threads\nCPU cores and threads are closely related but not the same. A core is a physical unit within the CPU that executes instructions, while a thread is a virtual sequence of instructions assigned to a core. Think of cores as workers and threads as the jobs they carry out.\n&gt; When CPU has 16 threads, it simply means it can run 16 threads simultaneously.\nBus width\nThe amount of data processed at a time depends on the “number of lightbulbs” or the width of the data bus\nBus width is measured in bits, e.g. 8-bits, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, etc.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\nHow many bits do you need in bus width to represent the Guy in the Box and their codebook from the previous problems?"

In binary, the idea is the same, but the largest digit is only 1. So whenever we get 1 + 1 in the same column, we carry over to the next place value (the next power of 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the CPU, special circuits called adder gates handle this process automatically. The sum is the result that stays in the current column, while the carry (C) is the extra 1 that “spills over” into the next column (the next power of 2).\n\n\n\nHalf-Adder gate 1➕1 Adds two single binary digits.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull-Adder 1➕1➕1: Adds two binary digits and includes the carry from a previous addition.",

    "text": "As we saw with Unicode, computers need to handle very large numbers to distinguish between the many possible characters and instructions. While computers work effortlessly with large binary numbers, we don’t! Converting 32-bit or 64-bit values from binary to decimal is tedious, which makes large binary numbers difficult for humans to read and write quickly.\nWe’re comfortable with large decimal numbers, but the problem is that 10 is not a power of 2. This means it doesn’t align neatly with the binary storage model computers rely on. For example, with just 4 bits we can represent values up to 16, but to store something slightly larger, like 17–20, we already need 5 bits.\nThe result is that decimal numbers cannot be directly stored in machines built from transistors that only distinguish between “on” (1) and “off” (0). So what’s the solution? We turn to hexadecimal—a system that maps perfectly onto binary while staying compact and much easier for humans to read and write.\nNotice that 16 is a power of 2: \\(2^4 = 16\\). This means every 4 bits (a nibble) can store one hexadecimal digit (a “hexit”), and with 8 bits we can store two “hexits”.\n\n\nThe hexadecimal system is base 16 🔢. This means we count from 0 to 15 before moving to the next place value. In decimal, we only have the digits 0–9 🔟. To show the extra numbers (10–15), we use the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F 🔠.\n\n\n\nHexadecimal\nBinary\nDecimal\n\n\n\n\n0\n0000\n0\n\n\n1\n0001\n1\n\n\n2\n0010\n2\n\n\n3\n0011\n3\n\n\n4\n0100\n4\n\n\n5\n0101\n5\n\n\n6\n0110\n6\n\n\n7\n0111\n7\n\n\n8\n1000\n8\n\n\n9\n1001\n9\n\n\nA\n1010\n10\n\n\nB\n1011\n11\n\n\nC\n1100\n12\n\n\nD\n1101\n13\n\n\nE\n1110\n14\n\n\nF\n1111\n15",

It also manages input and output operations and switches efficiently between different tasks.\n\n\nAs we’ve seen in the hardware module, the firmware of the motherboard, the BIOS (or UEFI) is responsible for “waking up” the hardware and loading the operating system.

    "text": "Unix vs Linux\nFor beginners, Unix and Linux are often confusing. Unix was developed in the 1960s by AT&T and served as the foundation for many modern operating systems, including macOS and Linux. You could compare Unix to Linux in the same way MS-DOS relates to Windows; both laid the groundwork for more advanced systems. However, there is one key difference: Linux was written entirely from scratch by Linus Torvalds, though it was designed to follow the Unix architecture."

    "text": "Kernel vs Shell\nMost operating system are made up of two important parts: - The Kernel - The Shell\n\n\n\nThe Kernel is the core of the operating system\n\n\nThe Kernel is the innermost part of the operating system and it is responsible for controlling the computer hardware components. It interacts with the devices such as the processor, the main memory, the storage devices, the inputs devices, output devices and communcation devices. It talks to the hardware through device drivers (small programs that connect the OS to each device) and keeps the system stable and running smoothly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOS is the Air traffic controller\n\n\n\nYou can think of the OS an air traffic controller at a busy airport. Where the programs running are like the airplanes and the hardware are the gates, runways, various terminals. The traffic controller must carefully coordinate takeoffs and landings, allocating runway space and assigning gates to the various airplanes going through. It’s must avoid collisions!\n\n\n\nThe Shell is the part of the operating system that lets the user interact with its functions. This can be done in two ways:\n\nThrough a Graphical User Interface (GUI) — often called “Gooey” — using windows, icons, and menus.\nThrough a Command-Line Interface (CLI) — by typing commands that the OS understands.\n\nThese typed commands are converted into binary instructions by the command interpreter, so the computer can execute them.\nExamples of command-line shells include:\n\nBash – used in Linux, macOS, and other Unix-based systems\nCmd – used in Windows (used to be MS-DOS)\n\n\n\nProgram, process versus thread\nYou might hear these terms used interchangeably, but they aren’t the same and you’ll learn them in more depth in your Operating Systems course next year.\nA program 📜 is a set of instructions written by a programmer like you. It runs when the operating system loads it into memory. You can have several instances of the same program running at once, each one is a separate process.\nA process ⚙️ is one active instance of a program running in memory (RAM). Each process works independently and has its own memory space. The OS keeps track of them using a unique process ID (PID).\nA thread 🧵 is a smaller unit of work inside a process. Threads let a process perform multiple tasks at the same time, just like CPU threads let the OS run several software threads simultaneously for multitasking. This will not be part of any evaluation in this course, but it’s still useful to understand when you start developing apps and web apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipResturant Analogy\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Operating System as the head chef in a busy restaurant, with several sous-chefs working under him. All the recipes—written 📜 by programmers are stored in a large file cabinet (the storage device).\nWhen a customer orders a cake, the chef (OS) retrieves the recipe, assigns it to a sous-chef, and provides the necessary ingredients, an oven (CPU), and a workspace (RAM) ⚙️\nTo speed things up, the chef can assign assistants to help the sous-chef, each handling smaller tasks in parallel 🧵, all sharing the same resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteActivity - Task manager\n\n\n\nTo observe the various process currently running on your computer, you can open the Task Manager on Windows: 1. Press the Alt + Ctrl + Del 2. Open the Task Manager\nOn a Mac, the equivalent is the Activity Monitor and on Linux it’s the System Monitor (or type the top command to display processes in the Terminal).\nYou’ll probably realize that many programs are actually using multiple processes at the same time!\nSometimes, a process is stalling or not responding. A useful tip is to know how to force it to stop running. 3. Right click the frozen program, click “End Task”\n\n\n\n\nOS and the CPU\nHow the OS speaks to the CPU, RAM and storage is a complex process and is out of scope for this course, but it’s useful to build a mental picture to to tie-in all the knowledge we’ve learned for far.\nAt this stage, you know that the CPU is an incredibly complex network of transistors linked by wires to the RAM. These connections allow the CPU to fetches instructions and data by reading specific addresses and values from memory. It then decodes them using its built-in codebook. The clock determines how often the CPU executes instructions, all happening in binary, where each transistor is either ON (1) or OFF (0).\nWhen a computer boots up, the BIOS (after the POST and hardware initialization) takes control of the CPU, and loads the Operating system. The OS will ten take control of the CPU to perform. When an app/program is launched, the operating system reserves space in RAM and loads the program’s machine code (binary intructions) into that space. It then updates the CPU’s program counter (a special register) to the starting address of the program in memory, this is what starts the execution of a program. In other words, the OS is the true brains of the computer and uses the CPU as its high speed calculator!\nThe OS also frequently switches the CPU’s focus from one program to another, creating the illusion of multitasking. In reality, the CPU is performing rapid task switching, handling one task at a time but so quickly that it feels simultaneous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOrganize this series of events..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS and RAM\nThe OS’s most important function is to manage the memory (RAM), more specifically it’ll allocate space in the RAM for various programs to run. Before diving into this process, let’s take a look at how memory is organized.\nEvery RAM stick is made of millions of memory cells organized as a matrix as learnt in the hardware module. To read/write to those cells, special circuitry connected to embedded wires called address lines can precisely access each “group” of 8 bits (1 byte) of data.\n\n\n\nHow the memory cells are accessed\n\n\nIf a data value needs more than 8 bits, it spans multiple memory locations. This means that a single value can occupy several addresses. Each unique combination of address bits identifies one specific memory location in RAM. Although addresses are stored in binary, they’re typically shown in hexadecimal for easier reading.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the memory space, Source: Main Memory by Chemketa College - Computer Science Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOrganize the RAM\n\n\n\nYou are working under Chef- OS who is trying to organize the following processes, in the various kitchen workstation of 8 bits. Three processes (sous-chefs) are competing for space in the RAM! 1. Process A wants to save the unsigned number 128 2. Process B wants to save the ascii text “Hi” 3. Process C wants to save the color #CCOOCC 4. Process B wants to modify the text to “Hi!”\nAssume that the OS is going to assign space by order of available workstations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical Memory\nModern CPUs use 64-bit data buses and 64-bit address buses. This means, in theory, a CPU could access up to \\(2^{64}\\) memory locations. If each location stores just 1 byte, that would equal roughly 18 million terabytes (\\(10^{18}\\) bytes) of memory!\nOf course, that’s not the case! Even the most powerful computers today have only a few hundred gigabytes of RAM. The operating system manages this difference by mapping logical addresses (what the programs running on CPU thinks exists) to physical addresses (the actual locations in RAM).\n\n\nVirtual Memory\nVirtual memory or logical memory is an abstraction of the memory location created by the Operating system to give the “illusion” to any program executing on the CPU that there is a lot more memory than there actually is! The job of the OS to map this virutal memory to physical memory and make sure it updates the mapping table.\n\n\n\nVirtual Memory Source: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtualization\nLet’s return to the restaurant analogy. Imagine the restaurant is completely full, and every bit of workspace is being used by the sous-chefs. New customer orders keep coming in, and Chef-OS needs more room to prepare urgent meals.\nTo make space, the chef notices that some sous-chefs are only prepping ingredients for tomorrow, not cooking right away. So, he decides to move them to the cold storage room at the back to free up tables for the urgent dishes. The sous-chefs set up a small workspace there and continue working, though it’s not ideal!\nIn computing, this is similar to virtual memory or swap space. When the system runs out of RAM, it borrows space from the storage drive to keep processes running. It helps temporarily, but relying on it too much can slow things down — and just like the sous-chefs, your computer won’t like working in those conditions!\n\n\n\nSous-chefs working in the cold room — representing data being moved from RAM to storage. Image Generated by Copilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuestion\n\n\n\nAn operating system allocates 1-byte memory blocks for two processes, A and B, running concurrently. The following sequence of events occurs:\n\nProcess B starts and stores the value 1024 in memory.\nProcess A starts and attempts to store the string “HELLO” in memory, but block 3 is already occupied by a third, unknown process.\nProcess B frees some memory space and stores the value 128.\nProcess A appends more text to its initial message, resulting in “HELLO WORLD!”.\n\nAssume each letter is 1 byte and that the OS allocates the memory blocks based on which are currently free. Determine in which order each piece of information will be stored in the physical RAM:\n\n\n\nAddress\nData\n\n\n\n\n0x00\n?\n\n\n0x01\n?\n\n\n0x02\n?\n\n\n\nValidate your answer here\n\n\n\n\nOS and Hardware - summary\nThe OS manages similar interactions with all hardware components.

    "text": "In 1946, the world’s first programmable electronic computer was created: the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). It was a massive machine, filling an entire room with thousands of vacuum tubes, and yet it laid the foundation for every modern computer we use today.\nThe ENIAC was programmed by a pioneering group of women, including Betty Jean Jennings and Fran Bilas, at the School of Electrical Engineering. During World War II, these women developed an expertise in programming and operating the machine. Their skills became so valuable that they were difficult to replace, even when soldiers returned from the war.\nThe ENIAC used vacuum tubes as switches to amplify or switch off the electricity in order to store bits, flip bits, and perform Boolean operations. This allowed the ENIAC to perform basic math and help with calculations.\nLogic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They take simple inputs (like 0s and 1s) and combine them using basic rules (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) to produce outputs. From these simple operations, computers can add numbers, compare values, store information, and eventually run complex software.\nBy studying logic gates, we connect the concepts seen in binary to electronic hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe ENIAC Programmers\n\n\n\n\nIn the early days of computing, there was a job called being a computer, where women, mostly women, some men, would calculate and compute.

    "text": "Everyone “knows” that computers use “binary” to operate\nBut, as we saw last class, computers don’t “know” anything ultimately, its CPU is just configured to react in particularly sophisticated ways when its switches (the lightbulbs for the “guy in the box”) are turned on or off.\nSo what is binary anyway? And what does it have to do with computers?\nIn order to understand the Binary numeral system, we can compare it to something we already know: the Decimal numeral system.\nIn decimal , numbers are represented by combinations of ten  different symbols: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\nWe call decimal a base 10 numeral system.\n\nIf we have more than “9” of something, another digit is needed (another power of ten):\n\n9 + 1 = 10\n99 + 1 = 100, etc.\n\n\nHow do we represent numbers in binary and how does it compare to binary?\nIn binary , there are only two symbols (0, 1).\nWe call binary a base 2 numeral system.\n\nIf we have more than “1” of something, another bit (power) is needed:\n\n1 + 1 = 10 (in english: one plus one equals two)\n11 + 1 = 100 (in english: three plus one equals four)\n\n\nIt’s counterintuitive at first! But there’s nothing fundamentally different about binary than decimal – we’re just more used to using decimal instead. Since we’re reusing the symbols 1 and 0 from the decimal system, there is a convention to use subscript to disambiguate between different numeral systems:\n\n\n12 + 12 = 102 is the same as 110 + 110 = 210 is the same as one plus one equals two\n112 + 12 = 1002 is the same as 310 + 110 = 410 is the same as three plus one equals four\n\n\nThese subscripts are not always required, but can be very useful when the numeral systems are mixed in the same context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: binary and decimal are not the only possible numeral systems. All that distinguishes numeral systems is the number of symbols you agree to use to represent numbers – there are infinite possible numeral systems!\nHexadecimal is another useful numeral system (16 symbols, or base 16) which we will discuss later in the course.",

These surfaces, when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode, cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset. Images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mouse"

    "text": "Introduction\nLast week we learned the basic behaviors that define computers – their ability to store, retrieve, and process information. This means that many simple devices, even non-electronics, can be considered computers.\nThe computers that we mostly are concerned with in the computer science profession, however, are generally complicated electronic devices made of many components. In this class, we are going to learn many of the fundamental components that make up modern computing devices.\nToday, we will start with the external, or peripheral, components of a computer – each of these have their own set of interesting behaviors and properties that are worth understanding.\nMany peripheral components of a computer can broadly be divided into two categories:\n\nInput Devices: devices that accept data and instructions from a user to a computer.\nOutput Devices: devices that present data and information to the user from a computer.\n\nWe will cover many examples of each.",

There are many types of mice, distinguished by tracking technology and by use case\nTechnology:\n\nMechanical mice use a ball to measure movement (obsolete now – why?)\nOptical mice use light sources (such as LED, or more precise Laser).1\nLED mice will often have a visible red light and require a non-glossy surface to properly work. Here’s an detailed explanation on how they work.\n\nLaser mice provide higher precision and sensitivity, detecting fine movements and can work on any surface including glass surfaces. However, they are susceptible to sensor acceleration, which causes inconsistent cursor movements based on the speed of movement.\n\nTypes of mouse\n\nGaming mouse: They offers additional buttons. These buttons are sometimes programmable. This is useful in a game and can replace a combination of instructions useful for realtime games.\n\nErgonomic mouse: provides optimum comfort and avoids repetitive strain injuries.\nWireless mouse: Connects to a computer via bluetooth or Wi-Fi, or using a receiver that plugs to the computer via USB.\nMany more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prototype computer mouse Doug Engelbart used in the Mother of All Demos in 1968.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMx Laser Cordless mouse introduced in 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA4Tech WOP-35 Optical mouse LED introduced in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMechanical mouse (unknown manufacturer) used in 80s and 90s”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard\nUsed to enter text commands.

    "text": "Output Devices\nOutput Devices are devices that present data and information to the user from a computer.\n\nMonitors\nThere are many different types of monitors use different technologies to create an image. However, the principles are the same:\n\nDigital representation of image to display is sent to the monitor\nThe monitor produces each pixel (the smallest element of the screen or “atom” of monitor displays) using some deterministic physical technology\nLight from the monitor reaches us as a useful/pleasing image.\n\nThe following sections are the main technologies used today (from oldest to newest)\n\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT)\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors are very complicated, very cool, moderately dangerous, and mostly obsolete!\n\nThe most common type of consumer and industry television before ~2010\nBasically: a tungsten coil is heated in a vacuum until it sheds electrons, those electrons are accelerated by an electric field and guided by magnets to hit a phosphor coated glass display to emit light in a pixel grid\nObsolete since today their are lighter, simpler higher resolution technologies\nStill used today for some applications due to zero latency .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation demonstrating the electron beam scanning the phosphorus screen and producing coloured light dots for each pixel. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma\nPlasma monitors use tiny cells of ionised gas that light up when stimulated by electricity.\n\nOften used in home theatre applications due to accurate video representation.\nHigh levels of brightness, deep black levels and very wide colour range.\nHave shorter life span, susceptible to “screen burn-in” (this is why screensavers are called “screen savers”! Same for CRT).\n\nPros\n\nPlasma cell will produce light that looks good from every angle, it has high refresh rate (videos are smoother)\n\nCons\n\nBUT! Consumes a lot of electricity\nDoesn’t work at high altitudes! (due to the low pressure)\n\n\n\n\nPlasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge). Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)\n\n\n\n\nLiquid Crystal Display (LCD)\nAn LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. Liquid cystal is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion). This technology allows for precise control of color without the need to ionise gas with powerful electronics.\n\nCommonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.\nConsists of a white backlight, two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution.\nAn electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.\n\nPros\n\nAllow the use of flat screens!\n\nCons\n\nDue to the backlight, black screens are never perfectly black! It always lets some light pass through.\nBecause of the polarizing filters, different viewing angles impact heavily the appearance of the image.\nSomewhat inefficient due to the many layers reducing the brightness of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through. An LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. The projector beam will emit white light which contains all wavelengths. Liquid crystal is a molecule between liquid and crytal state (ordered vs unordered) which has the characteristics of changing orientation under specific voltage. This allows for a precise control of the passage of light. To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face - made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green). This video provides a full explanation\n\n\n\n\nLight emitting diode (LED)\n\nAn LCD display that uses LED backlighting instead of a white backlight to light the display. It still uses Liquid crystals (LCD technology). The brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel.\n\nPros\n\nThinner (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast\nLower power  consumption.\nBetter representation of blacks (compared to original LCDs)\nImproved color filters using quantum dots, which creates vibrant colors.\nHave become the most affordable types of Monitors.\nLEDs backlight lasts for very long making them less susceptible to burn-in compared to OLED screens.\n\nCons\n\nNot yet a perfect representation of black!\nThe individual light diodes level of light is not controlled, it’s still requires liquid crystals to modulate the light.\nThis means that polarized light is still used reducing the viewing angles compared to OLED screens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED Grid used for backlighting of each individual pixel. -\n\n\n\n\nOrganic LED (OLED)\nOLED displays are similar to LED, but no backlighting required – the organic material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied.\n\nSimilar to LED, but no backlighting required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied .\n\nPros\n\nAllows for perfect representation of dark colors unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive to produce\nMore susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)\n\nHere’s a great video (8 mins) explaining both physical and software technologies required to make the above monitors work.\nWith LCD, LED, and OLED, we finally get to the most modern monitor technologies. These are used in our labs, most computers, laptops. They’re ordered here approximately in order of lowest (LCD) -&gt; highest (OLED) quality, though pros and cons exist for each.\nSee here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays.\n\n\n\nMetrics for choosing the right monitor\nThe first step is to define how the monitor will be used: personal vs. professional use, gaming, graphic design, content creation, etc. You should look for a monitor that meets your needs based on a few common metrics:\n\nResolution: Indicates how many pixels are used to display an image and how small they are. Higher-resolution monitors (e.g., 4K) offer sharper and more detailed images.\nRefresh Rate: Refers to how many times per second the display updates the image, measured in hertz (Hz), such as 60Hz. It is closely related to the frames per second (FPS) that the computer’s graphics card can output.\nColor Accuracy: Describes how accurately the display reproduces colors. There are various standards to measure color accuracy, but this can be a somewhat subjective criterion depending on the use case.\nBrightness: Measures the intensity of light emitted by the display, expressed in nits. Optimal brightness levels range from 100–300 nits for indoor use and 400–700 nits for outdoor use.\nContrast: Indicates the difference in intensity between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks on the screen. It is typically expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1000:1). Good contrast enhances image sharpness, especially around edges and areas with opposing colors.\n\n\n\nDisplay Technologies Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPlasma\nLCD (CCFL backlight)\nLED (LCD with LED backlight)\nOLED\n\n\n\n\nLight Source\nIonized gases excite phosphors (self-light)\nCold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFL) backlight\nLight Emitting Diodes (LED) backlight\nSelf-emitting organic pixels (no backlight)\n\n\nThickness\nBulky, heavy\nThicker than LED\nThinner, lighter than LCD\nUltra-thin, even flexible\n\n\nBrightness\nHigh, but reflective in bright rooms\nModerate\nHigh, adjustable\nHigh, but may degrade over time\n\n\nContrast Ratio\nVery good (deep blacks, but not infinite)\nLower (backlight bleed)\nBetter than LCD, especially with local dimming\nExcellent (true blacks, infinite contrast)\n\n\nViewing Angles\nVery wide\nLimited\nBetter than LCD but not as good as Plasma/OLED\nExcellent, wide and consistent\n\n\nColor Accuracy\nVivid, rich colors\nGood, but limited by backlight\nBetter than LCD\nExcellent, most accurate and vibrant\n\n\nRefresh Rates\nVery fast (good for motion, sports)\nSlower\nFaster than LCD\nVery fast\n\n\nPower Use\nHigh (power-hungry, generates heat)\nHigher than LED\nLower (more efficient than LCD & Plasma)\nEfficient for dark scenes; higher on full bright screen\n\n\nBurn-in Risk\nHigh\nVery low\nVery low\nMedium (improved but possible)\n\n\nLifespan\nShorter (phosphors fade)\nLong\nLong\nMedium to long (organic material degrades)\n\n\nPrice\nExpensive (when available)\nCheapest\nMid-range\nMost expensive\n\n\nCurrent Status\nObsolete (no longer made)\nRare now, replaced by LED\nMost common today\nPremium, used in high-end TVs, monitors, smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinters\nPrinters take data from a computer and generate output on paper: Basic principles\n\nSimilar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)\nRather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper. The physical setup is different, but the same principles are at work.\n\n\n\n\nA high enough quantity of toasted bread produces the qualitative impression of a human eye in this “piece” of art. Printers (and monitors) use much higher quantities of “pixels” than depicted here!\n\n\n\nDot-matrix printers\n\nUses print heads containing pins which produce patterns of dots on the paper by mechanical impact (pressing).\nInexpensive and typically print at a speed of 100 - 600 characters per second.\n(Optional) See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer for more detail on history and technology\nWhile still in use for particular applications (printing receipts for e.g.), these are now obsoleted by ink-jet printers.\n\n\n\nInk-jet printers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk-jet printer technology.

(speed of light in glass).\n\nA short paper (5 pages) comparing the two cable technologies in more detail: Fibre Optics vs Copper Cabling: Understanding the Differences\n\n\n\nAnalog versus Digital signal cables\n\nAnalog cables carry a continuous and fluctuating electrical signal representing the original penomena (example sound waves).\nDigital cables transmit a binary discrete (sequence of 1 or 0)\n\n\n\nUSB\n\nUniversal Serial Bus is used to connect most modern devices to computers.\nBack in the day, mice/keyboards/external storage, speakers, etc., all had different cables. These have now been mostly unified under the USB standard.\nUSB connectors can transmit both power (e.g. charging phones) and information (data). Despite being “Universal” there are an incredible number of USB types.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of USB connectors\n\n\n\n\nUSB Standards\nUSB “Number” Standards determines the transmission speed & power\n\n🐢 USB 2 (slower, less power)\n🏎️ USB 3 (faster, more power)\n🚀 USB 4 (super fast, high power)\n\nUSB “Letter” Standards refer to the physical design of the connector and the port\n\ne.g. USB C and USB A are incompatible interfaces, cannot be interchanged.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of USB standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer standards are backwards compatible (e.g. USB 3.1 cable works in USB 1.1 port at USB 1.1 speed/power)\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio\nA headphone jack is a port into which you plug your headphones. Sometimes called AUX, audio jack or phone jack. The plug, on the other hand,is the part at the end of your headphones’ cable that is inserted into the jack. Most commonly the standard headphone jack (TSR connector). Available in several sizes, most commonly 3.5mm or ⅛” mini audio jack. Can be color coded - microphone (pink), speaker (green).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeadphone Jack vs Plug\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious sizes of TSR connector (headphone jack)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor higher-end audio, we can use fiberoptic cables as these can transmit larger amounts of data more quickly, which is required for producing a high-quality audio signal.\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of video cables\n\n\nVGA cable is analog signal cable used for computer monitors. It had 15 pins arranged in 3 rows. It’s a low resolution cable and now obsolete. There exist converter cables to connect VGA monitors to newer computers.\nMiniVGA is a variant found on laptops.\nDVI cabe is analog/digital upgrade from VGA, capable of higher resolutions. It isn’t used as much today. MiniDVI and MicroDVI on “thin” laptops.\nS-Video commonly used for DVD players, camcorders and older consoles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVGA, DVI, and RCA cables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDVI. Can be distinguished from VGA by noticing that it is a much wider interface with many more pins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS-video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converter from mini-DP to three possible outputs: DP, DVI, and HDMI\n\n\n\n\n\nRCA cables include composite video (yellow) and stereo audio cables (red for right; white/black for left). It’s mainly an analog cable. Component video offers a better picture. &gt; RCA stands for Radio Corporation America.\nHDMI is the new standard for audio and video transmission in a single cable. It transmits digital signal only. It allows for a single cable to carry both audio and video simplifying connections and improving signal quality.\nDisplayPort (and Mini DisplayPort) more commonly used in desktop computers. It transmits digital signal only. It support the transmission of audio, video, and other additional data, as well as multi-channel audio, and support multi monitor configurations. It is  widely used in professional applications and high-performance computing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHDMI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\neSATA (External Serial Advanced Technology Attachement) is used internally to connect the hard drive to the motherboard but can also be used for portable hard drives. They provide a high-speed interface for transferring data between the external storage device and the host system. We will see them in the upcoming labs.\n\nThe current trend has seen a decline in the use of eSATA by USB type C.\n\n\n\n\nNetworking\nTelephone cable (RJ11) used for connecting to the internet through DSL/ADSL modems. Standard phone cable has 4 wires; connector has 4 pins. Clip helps to maintain tight connection.\nEthernet (RJ45) is the standard for wired networking.

For example, you may have a horizontal bar at the top of the screen as such:\n\n\n\nExample of BIOS setup utility Source: LifeWire\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the BIOS’s navigation instructions, locate the boot order option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample of boot order option\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of boot order in the BIOS settings tool\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the BIOS’s instructions, modify the boot order so that the boot device you wish to use is at the top.\nConfirm the changes, this may re-start the computer.\n\nOnce the computer restarts, it’ll attempt to boot from the first device specified in the order. If it cannot boot, it’ll try the next device in the list.\nSource: Mastering BIOS: How to Change the Boot Order By Time Fisher. July 18, 2025. LifeWire",

This helps protect against malicious software such as rootkits.",

Exam easy or hard?\nThe first section of students of Tech Support collectively decided not to study for their mid-term exam and instead build a truth table to predict if the exam will be easy or hard based on their teacher’s mood.\nThey built a logic gate diagram, where the output is a light bulb. If it turns on, the exam will be easy, and everyone passes.\nThey have four switches that can turn on/off independently. The first switch represents if the weather is above 0 degrees Celsius in Canada. The second switch represents if it’s snowing outside (negative temperatures). The third switch represents if the exam is happening on a Thursday and the last switch represents if the exam is happening on a Friday.\n\n\nLet’s imagine it is snowing on Exam Day.
