    "text": "Have you ever wondered how simply pressing the power button makes a whole computer come to life? The ON/OFF button only supplies electricity to the motherboard — but what actually triggers the operating system to load into memory is a special built-in program called the BIOS.\nThe BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is embedded program on the motherboard that initializes the computer’s input and output devices during startup. The motherboard is often referred to as the firmware of the motherboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFirmware vs Software\n\n\n\nA firmware is a low level code running on ROM (Read-only-memory) chips of a hardware device to directly control it. It’s often written in low level languages like Assembly, C/C++,or Rust.\nA software, on the other hand, refers to higher-level programs/instructions created by developers (like you!). Software relies on the firmware to interact with the hardware. It includes components such as the operating system.\n\n\n\nFirmware vs Software\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe BIOS is burnt onto a read only memory chip built-into the motherboard: \n\n\nROM chips contain instructions that are directly accessed by the CPU, for example booting the computer and loading the operating system. Those chips retain their content even when the computer is powered off. Over time the ROM chips have evolved from purely ROM which can never be earased or over-written to EEPROM which are now electronically earasable and programmable. The information written on EEPROM can be rewritten without having to remove the actual chip from the computer.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the motherboard receives power, the BIOS loads from its dedicated chip into memory and immediately performs a diagnostic procedure called the Power-On Self-Test (POST). The order of hardware devices checked during the BIOS is typically from the most important components (CPU, RAM, CPU fan, graphics card) to the less essential peripherals (mouse, keyboard).\nThis special test is called POST or Power-On-Self Test and will be helpful in troubleshooting any problem. The post test uses a combination of lights and sounds codes to indicate issues. Typically a black screen (BIOS) with error messages will be insicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOptiplex 990 POST test example\n\n\n\nOn some PCs such as the Dell OptiPlex series, there exists up to 4 LED lights on the front panel which light up during the POST test and indicate error codes if an error occurs. Here is an example of an error code which happened during the POST:\n\nWhen searching through the error codes for the Optiplex 990, this is the meaning of this code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the POST, the BIOS will search for the boot device, i.e. the storage device containing the operating system. For that, the BIOS will check for a special software called the “boot loader” which loads the operating system into memory. To find this software, the BIOS will go through the boot order starting from the first device in the order (often the permanent storage devices (SSD or HDD)), then through the secondary and tertiary devices (ex: CD-ROM drives, and/or removable disks) until it finds a bootable device.\n\n\nWhen installing a new operating system or using a data recovery tool, the boot order might need to be alterned.\n\nTurn ON or restart the computer\nDuring POST, open the BIOS setup utility by pressing the F2, F10 or F12 key (Dell and Hp) and sometimes F1.\nOnce in the BIOS setup utility, use the arrow keys to navigate through the menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteBIOS setup utlity\n\n\n\nThe BIOS appearance might be different from one manufacturer to another. For example, you may have a horizontal bar at the top of the screen as such:\n\n\n\nExample of BIOS setup utility Source: LifeWire\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow the BIOS’s navigation instructions, locate the boot order option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample of boot order option\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of boot order in the BIOS settings tool\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the BIOS’s instructions, modify the boot order so that the boot device you wish to use is at the top.\nConfirm the changes, this may re-start the computer.\n\nOnce the computer restarts, it’ll attempt to boot from the first device specified in the order. If it cannot boot, it’ll try the next device in the list.\nSource: Mastering BIOS: How to Change the Boot Order By Time Fisher. July 18, 2025. LifeWire\n\n\n\n\nAltough the BIOS is stored on a Read-only Programmable memory chip, some of its settings are changeable and will be stored on the CMOS chip. Here are a few settings that are changeable:\n\n🕒 System Date/Time Sets the system’s date and time.\n💾 Boot Sequence Defines the order in which the BIOS attempts to load the operating system.\n🔌 Plug and Play Allows automatic detection of connected hardware devices.\n⌨️ Mouse / Keyboard Enables Num Lock, auto-detect the mouse, and adjust input settings.\n💽 Drive Configuration Configures storage devices such as hard drives, CD-ROMs, and floppy drives.\n🔐 Security Sets or changes passwords to restrict access to the computer.\n⚡ Power Management Enables or disables power-saving features and adjust standby or suspend timers.",

    "text": "2. Power Supply (PSU) ⚡\nMain purpose: Converts AC power (alternating current) from wall socket to DC power (direct current). Direct current (0 or 5V) is used to power digital circuits.\n\nComputers can only tolerate slight fluctuations in power without needing to shut down!. This is why we need to convert the electric current from the providers to direct current.\nPSUs have their own fans because energy conversion releases a lot of heat!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningNever open a power supply!\n\n\n\nThe capacitors contained within can keep a dangerous high voltage, high power charge long after being unplugged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Supply rated “Gold”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Power Supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference between AC vs DC current.\n\n\n\n2.1 PSU Connectors 🔌🔋\n\nMost power supply connectors are : 20 + 4 pins\nUsually made up of wires of various colors:\n\nYellow 12V\nRed 5V\nOrange 3.3V\nOther colors may be ground 0V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsual PSU connectors\n\n\n\n\n2.2 PSU Ratings 🏅\nNot all PSUs efficiently convert AC to DC power!\nTo pick the right power supply for your machine, you must firstly know what’s the wattage required by your system. For this you might need to add all the internal components into the Wattage calculator which will then provide an estimate of the load wattage of this machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nIf you’re building a PC with an Intel Core i7-11700K CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, 16 gigabytes (GB) of RAM made up of two 8GB sticks, a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD), and a 1TB 7200RPM hard disk drive (HDD), then 512 watts of power would be recommended.\n\n\n\n80 Plus Standard\nThe 80 Plus standard was created to promote efficient enery use of a computer. When selecting a power supply, you might see that many suppliers will carry the 80 Plus certification labels. The efficiency of a power supply gives the ratio of AC power required from an electrical outlet to the useful power converted to DC to be used by a computer (the load wattage).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample\n\n\n\nA 75% efficient power supply requires 100W of AC input to provide 75 W of DC load wattage output to a computer. dissipating the remaining 25 W in as heat.\n\n\nIn the North America, the outlet voltage is roughly 115 V. The following table summerizes the efficiency levels for that voltage.\n\n\n\n% of Rated Load\n10%\n20%\n50%\n100%\n\n\n\n\n80 PLUS\n-\n80%\n80%\n80%\n\n\n80 PLUS Bronze\n-\n82%\n85%\n82%\n\n\n80 PLUS Silver\n-\n85%\n88%\n85%\n\n\n80 PLUS Gold\n-\n87%\n90%\n87%\n\n\n80 PLUS Platinum\n-\n90%\n92%\n89%\n\n\n80 PLUS Titanium\n90%\n92%\n94%\n90%\n\n\n\nAfter figuring out the required wattage for your machine, you can then calculate the input wattage required by the PSU to reach the desired load wattage of your machine.\n\nFor more detailed explanation: How to Choose a Power Supply\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Uninterruptible Power Supply\nIn the case of a power outage, an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) can keep a computer running for a few minutes to several hours depending on the sophistication of the UPS. See Uninterruptible Power Supply for an example.\nIt’s basically a large battery that keeps charge during normal operation, and powers a computer using its stored charge when the building’s power is cut off.",

Most motherboards look something like this.\n\n\n\nComposed of various chips all combined into north  and south bridges\nMain circuit board and controls the electrical pathways (buses) found in a computer.\nThe buses allow data to travel between the various components of a computer.\nVarious form factors, e.g. AT, ATX, LPX, BTX, ITX.\n\n\n\n\nMotherboard form factors, from largest to smallest.\n\n\n\n3.1 Form Factors\n\nAT\n\nInvented by IBM in early 1980s, now obsolete.\nHuge in size (approximately 12 x 13 inches).\nNeeded lots of space for power supply and its various chips.\nLacked external ports, only allowed for monitor and keyboard.\n\nATX\n\nCreated in 1995 to meet the need for more connectors.\nGot off to a slow start but by 1998 became the most common form factor.\nBiggest change to AT was the rear panel with standard set of ports for expansion.\nPower supply position for better airflow, CPU and RAM positioned for easier access.\nVariations 12x9in (full size), 9.6x9.6in ( microATX )\n\nATX and microATX are the most common in personal desktop computers today\n\n\n\nITX\n\nCreated in 2001 to meet the demand for smaller computers.\nITX failed but led to development of smaller form factor (SSF) motherboards.\nMiniITX (6.7x6.7in), NanoITX (4.7x4.7in) and PicoITX (3.8x2.8in)\nCommonly used for embedded systems and specialized devices such as routers.\nRequire very little power, therefore produce less heat.\n\nProprietary\n\nSome computer manufacturers make motherboards that work only with their cases. (Ahemm…🍏)\nServices and upgrades usually need to be handled by authorized dealers.\nOften hard to get replacement parts and they are usually expensive.\n\n\n\n\n3.2 I/O Ports\nYou’ll notice that the I/O Ports (input/output) on the mother board are always located around the same area. This is to keep certain consistency across manufacturer and regardless of the form factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI/O Ports location standard accross manufacturer and form factors.\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Expansion Slots\nLet’s have a closer look at what we call expansion slots.\nExpansion slots are ports inside a computer found on the motherboard. They provide the possibility to expand the hardware of your PC.\nFor example, you may want to install a network card, a sound card, and most commonly, a video card.\n\n\n\nExpansion slot\n\n\n\nExpansion slots allow us to increase the functionality of a computer by adding controllers for specific devices (often called adapter cards) e.g. sound, video, NIC (network Interface Card).\n\nPCI used in most computers, commonly used for network interface\nAGP designed to be used by video adapters\nPCIe replaces AGP in newer computers, used for video cards\nISA older, rarely used, 8 or 16 bit\nEISA older, rarely used, 32 bit\nMCA IBM proprietary 32 bit, older, rarely used\nPCI-X 32 bit, can run up to four times faster than PCI\nMiniPCI 32 bit, used by laptops, has three different form factors\n\nIn 2024 : PCI  and PCIe  are the common standards that cover all features required for expansion slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Interfact Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNVidea Video Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple expansion slots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of expansion slots.

    "text": "2. Power Supply (PSU) ⚡\nMain purpose: Converts AC power (alternating current) from wall socket to DC power (direct current). Direct current (0 or 5V) is used to power digital circuits.\n\nComputers can only tolerate slight fluctuations in power without needing to shut down!. This is why we need to convert the electric current from the providers to direct current.\nPSUs have their own fans because energy conversion releases a lot of heat!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNever open a power supply!\n\n\nThe capacitors contained within can keep a dangerous high voltage, high power charge long after being unplugged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Supply rated “Gold”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular Power Supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference between AC vs DC current.\n\n\n2.1 PSU Connectors 🔌🔋\n\nMost power supply connectors are : 20 + 4 pins\nUsually made up of wires of various colors:\n\nYellow 12V\nRed 5V\nOrange 3.3V\nOther colors may be ground 0V\n\n\n\n\n\nUsual PSU connectors\n\n\n2.2 PSU Ratings 🏅\nNot all PSUs efficiently convert AC to DC power!\nTo pick the right power supply for your machine, you must firstly know what’s the wattage required by your system. For this you might need to add all the internal components into the Wattage calculator which will then provide an estimate of the load wattage of this machine.\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nIf you’re building a PC with an Intel Core i7-11700K CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 GPU, 16 gigabytes (GB) of RAM made up of two 8GB sticks, a 1TB solid-state drive (SSD), and a 1TB 7200RPM hard disk drive (HDD), then 512 watts of power would be recommended.\n\n\n\n80 Plus Standard\nThe 80 Plus standard was created to promote efficient enery use of a computer. When selecting a power supply, you might see that many suppliers will carry the 80 Plus certification labels. The efficiency of a power supply gives the ratio of AC power required from an electrical outlet to the useful power converted to DC to be used by a computer (the load wattage).\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nA 75% efficient power supply requires 100W of AC input to provide 75 W of DC load wattage output to a computer. dissipating the remaining 25 W in as heat.\n\n\n\nIn the North America, the outlet voltage is roughly 115 V. The following table summerizes the efficiency levels for that voltage.\n\n\n\n% of Rated Load\n10%\n20%\n50%\n100%\n\n\n\n\n80 PLUS\n-\n80%\n80%\n80%\n\n\n80 PLUS Bronze\n-\n82%\n85%\n82%\n\n\n80 PLUS Silver\n-\n85%\n88%\n85%\n\n\n80 PLUS Gold\n-\n87%\n90%\n87%\n\n\n80 PLUS Platinum\n-\n90%\n92%\n89%\n\n\n80 PLUS Titanium\n90%\n92%\n94%\n90%\n\n\n\nAfter figuring out the required wattage for your machine, you can then calculate the input wattage required by the PSU to reach the desired load wattage of your machine.\n\nFor more detailed explanation: How to Choose a Power Supply\n\n2.3 Uninterruptible Power Supply\nIn the case of a power outage, an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) can keep a computer running for a few minutes to several hours depending on the sophistication of the UPS. See Uninterruptible Power Supply for an example.\nIt’s basically a large battery that keeps charge during normal operation, and powers a computer using its stored charge when the building’s power is cut off."

    "text": "Output Devices\nOutput Devices are devices that present data and information to the user from a computer.\n\nMonitors\nThere are many different types of monitors use different technologies to create an image. However, the principles are the same:\n\nDigital representation of image to display is sent to the monitor\nThe monitor produces each pixel (the smallest element of the screen or “atom” of monitor displays) using some deterministic physical technology\nLight from the monitor reaches us as a useful/pleasing image.\n\nThe following sections are the main technologies used today (from oldest to newest)\n\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT)\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors are very complicated, very cool, moderately dangerous, and mostly obsolete!\n\nThe most common type of consumer and industry television before ~2010\nBasically: a tungsten coil is heated in a vacuum until it sheds electrons, those electrons are accelerated by an electric field and guided by magnets to hit a phosphor coated glass display to emit light in a pixel grid\nObsolete since today their are lighter, simpler higher resolution technologies\nStill used today for some applications due to zero latency .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation demonstrating the electron beam scanning the phosphorus screen and producing coloured light dots for each pixel. Image Source: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma\nPlasma monitors use tiny cells of ionised gas that light up when stimulated by electricity.\n\nOften used in home theatre applications due to accurate video representation.\nHigh levels of brightness, deep black levels and very wide colour range.\nHave shorter life span, susceptible to “screen burn-in” (this is why screensavers are called “screen savers”! Same for CRT).\n\nPros\n\nPlasma cell will produce light that looks good from every angle, it has high refresh rate (videos are smoother)\n\nCons\n\nBUT! Consumes a lot of electricity\nDoesn’t work at high altitudes! (due to the low pressure)\n\n\n\n\nPlasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge). Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)\n\n\n\n\nLiquid Crystal Display (LCD)\nAn LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. Liquid cystal is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion). This technology allows for precise control of color without the need to ionise gas with powerful electronics.\n\nCommonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.\nConsists of a white backlight, two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution.\nAn electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.\n\nPros\n\nAllow the use of flat screens!\n\nCons\n\nDue to the backlight, black screens are never perfectly black! It always lets some light pass through.\nBecause of the polarizing filters, different viewing angles impact heavily the appearance of the image.\nSomewhat inefficient due to the many layers reducing the brightness of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through. An LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. The projector beam will emit white light which contains all wavelengths. Liquid crystal is a molecule between liquid and crytal state (ordered vs unordered) which has the characteristics of changing orientation under specific voltage. This allows for a precise control of the passage of light. To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face - made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green). This video provides a full explanation\n\n\n\n\nLight emitting diode (LED)\n\nAn LCD display that uses LED backlighting instead of a white backlight to light the display. It still uses Liquid crystals (LCD technology). The brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel.\n\nPros\n\nThinner (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast\nLower power  consumption.\nBetter representation of blacks (compared to original LCDs)\nImproved color filters using quantum dots, which creates vibrant colors.\nHave become the most affordable types of Monitors.\nLEDs backlight lasts for very long making them less susceptible to burn-in compared to OLED screens.\n\nCons\n\nNot yet a perfect representation of black!\nThe individual light diodes level of light is not controlled, it’s still requires liquid crystals to modulate the light.\nThis means that polarized light is still used reducing the viewing angles compared to OLED screens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED Grid used for backlighting of each individual pixel. -\n\n\n\n\nOrganic LED (OLED)\nOLED displays are similar to LED, but no backlighting required – the organic material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied.\n\nSimilar to LED, but no backlighting required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied .\n\nPros\n\nAllows for perfect representation of dark colors unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive to produce\nMore susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)\n\nHere’s a great video (8 mins) explaining both physical and software technologies required to make the above monitors work.\nWith LCD, LED, and OLED, we finally get to the most modern monitor technologies. These are used in our labs, most computers, laptops. They’re ordered here approximately in order of lowest (LCD) -&gt; highest (OLED) quality, though pros and cons exist for each.\nSee here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays.\n\n\n\nMetrics for choosing the right monitor\nThe first step is to define how the monitor will be used: personal vs. professional use, gaming, graphic design, content creation, etc. You should look for a monitor that meets your needs based on a few common metrics:\n\nResolution: Indicates how many pixels are used to display an image and how small they are. Higher-resolution monitors (e.g., 4K) offer sharper and more detailed images.\nRefresh Rate: Refers to how many times per second the display updates the image, measured in hertz (Hz), such as 60Hz. It is closely related to the frames per second (FPS) that the computer’s graphics card can output.\nColor Accuracy: Describes how accurately the display reproduces colors. There are various standards to measure color accuracy, but this can be a somewhat subjective criterion depending on the use case.\nBrightness: Measures the intensity of light emitted by the display, expressed in nits. Optimal brightness levels range from 100–300 nits for indoor use and 400–700 nits for outdoor use.\nContrast: Indicates the difference in intensity between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks on the screen. It is typically expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1000:1). Good contrast enhances image sharpness, especially around edges and areas with opposing colors.\n\n\n\nDisplay Technologies Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPlasma\nLCD (CCFL backlight)\nLED (LCD with LED backlight)\nOLED\n\n\n\n\nLight Source\nIonized gases excite phosphors (self-light)\nCold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFL) backlight\nLight Emitting Diodes (LED) backlight\nSelf-emitting organic pixels (no backlight)\n\n\nThickness\nBulky, heavy\nThicker than LED\nThinner, lighter than LCD\nUltra-thin, even flexible\n\n\nBrightness\nHigh, but reflective in bright rooms\nModerate\nHigh, adjustable\nHigh, but may degrade over time\n\n\nContrast Ratio\nVery good (deep blacks, but not infinite)\nLower (backlight bleed)\nBetter than LCD, especially with local dimming\nExcellent (true blacks, infinite contrast)\n\n\nViewing Angles\nVery wide\nLimited\nBetter than LCD but not as good as Plasma/OLED\nExcellent, wide and consistent\n\n\nColor Accuracy\nVivid, rich colors\nGood, but limited by backlight\nBetter than LCD\nExcellent, most accurate and vibrant\n\n\nRefresh Rates\nVery fast (good for motion, sports)\nSlower\nFaster than LCD\nVery fast\n\n\nPower Use\nHigh (power-hungry, generates heat)\nHigher than LED\nLower (more efficient than LCD & Plasma)\nEfficient for dark scenes; higher on full bright screen\n\n\nBurn-in Risk\nHigh\nVery low\nVery low\nMedium (improved but possible)\n\n\nLifespan\nShorter (phosphors fade)\nLong\nLong\nMedium to long (organic material degrades)\n\n\nPrice\nExpensive (when available)\nCheapest\nMid-range\nMost expensive\n\n\nCurrent Status\nObsolete (no longer made)\nRare now, replaced by LED\nMost common today\nPremium, used in high-end TVs, monitors, smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinters\nPrinters take data from a computer and generate output on paper: Basic principles\n\nSimilar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)\nRather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper.

In this class, we are going to learn many of the fundamental components that make up modern computing devices.\nToday, we will start with the external, or peripheral, components of a computer – each of these have their own set of interesting behaviors and properties that are worth understanding.\nMany peripheral components of a computer can broadly be divided into two categories:\n\nInput Devices: devices that accept data and instructions from a user to a computer.\nOutput Devices: devices that present data and information to the user from a computer.\n\nWe will cover many examples of each."

    "text": "Everyone “knows” that computers use “binary” to operate\nBut, as we saw last class, computers don’t “know” anything ultimately, its CPU is just configured to react in particularly sophisticated ways when its switches (the lightbulbs for the “guy in the box”) are turned on or off.\nSo what is binary anyway? And what does it have to do with computers?\nIn order to understand the Binary numeral system, we can compare it to something we already know: the Decimal numeral system.\nIn decimal , numbers are represented by combinations of ten  different symbols: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\nWe call decimal a base 10 numeral system.\n\nIf we have more than “9” of something, another digit is needed (another power of ten):\n\n9 + 1 = 10\n99 + 1 = 100, etc.\n\n\nHow do we represent numbers in binary and how does it compare to binary?\nIn binary , there are only two symbols (0, 1).\nWe call binary a base 2 numeral system.\n\nIf we have more than “1” of something, another bit (power) is needed:\n\n1 + 1 = 10 (in english: one plus one equals two)\n11 + 1 = 100 (in english: three plus one equals four)\n\n\nIt’s counterintuitive at first! But there’s nothing fundamentally different about binary than decimal – we’re just more used to using decimal instead. Since we’re reusing the symbols 1 and 0 from the decimal system, there is a convention to use subscript to disambiguate between different numeral systems:\n\n\n12 + 12 = 102 is the same as 110 + 110 = 210 is the same as one plus one equals two\n112 + 12 = 1002 is the same as 310 + 110 = 410 is the same as three plus one equals four\n\n\nThese subscripts are not always required, but can be very useful when the numeral systems are mixed in the same context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: binary and decimal are not the only possible numeral systems. All that distinguishes numeral systems is the number of symbols you agree to use to represent numbers – there are infinite possible numeral systems!\nHexadecimal is another useful numeral system (16 symbols, or base 16) which we will discuss later in the course.",

    "text": "How are Bits physically implemented?\nThere are various ways to design circuits that effectively differentiate between “on” and “off” states. One method involves using a transistor, which can either be switched on or off to represent binary information. Another approach uses a capacitor, where its state of being charged or discharged conveys the desired data. In magnetic disks (like HDDs), information is stored as bits based on the direction of the magnetic field, either north-south or south-north. Similarly, on optical discs (such as CD-ROMs), bits are represented by whether a bit on the surface is shiny or not shiny. Lastly, over telephone lines or through radio, binary data is transmitted using high or low-pitched tones to represent the bits. Each of these methods relies on a distinct physical characteristic to represent binary information reliably.\n\n\n\nCapacitors can be charged or uncharged in RAM\n\n\n\n\n\nA transistor is ON or OFF in any chip of the computer such as the CPU and GPU Source: Any PCB",

Historically, the size of a byte was hardware-dependent, with no universal standard governing its size. However, in 1993, a standard was introduced that defined the size of a byte as 8 bits, a convention that is now widely adopted across modern computing systems. This standardization has helped ensure consistency in how data is stored and processed across different platforms and devices.",

    "text": "How are Bits physically implemented?\nThere are various ways to design circuits that effectively differentiate between “on” and “off” states. One method involves using a transistor, which can either be switched on or off to represent binary information. Another approach uses a capacitor, where its state of being charged or discharged conveys the desired data. In magnetic disks (like HDDs), information is stored as bits based on the direction of the magnetic field, either north-south or south-north. Similarly, on optical discs (such as CD-ROMs), bits are represented by whether a bit on the surface is shiny or not shiny. Lastly, over telephone lines or through radio, binary data is transmitted using high or low-pitched tones to represent the bits. Each of these methods relies on a distinct physical characteristic to represent binary information reliably.\n\n\n\nCapacitors can be charged or uncharged in RAM\n\n\n\n\n\nA transistor is ON or OFF in any chip of the computer such as the CPU and GPU Source: Any PCB"

    "text": "History of Bytes 📖\nA byte represents the number of bits used to encode a single character in a computer, making it the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. Historically, the size of a byte was hardware-dependent, with no universal standard governing its size. However, in 1993, a standard was introduced that defined the size of a byte as 8 bits, a convention that is now widely adopted across modern computing systems. This standardization has helped ensure consistency in how data is stored and processed across different platforms and devices."

    "text": "In 1946, the world’s first programmable electronic computer was created: the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). It was a massive machine, filling an entire room with thousands of vacuum tubes, and yet it laid the foundation for every modern computer we use today.\nThe ENIAC was programmed by a pioneering group of women, including Betty Jean Jennings and Fran Bilas, at the School of Electrical Engineering. During World War II, these women developed an expertise in programming and operating the machine. Their skills became so valuable that they were difficult to replace, even when soldiers returned from the war.\nThe ENIAC used vacuum tubes as switches to amplify or switch off the electricity in order to store bits, flip bits, and perform Boolean operations. This allowed the ENIAC to perform basic math and help with calculations.\nLogic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. They take simple inputs (like 0s and 1s) and combine them using basic rules (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) to produce outputs. From these simple operations, computers can add numbers, compare values, store information, and eventually run complex software.\nBy studying logic gates, we connect the concepts seen in binary to electronic hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe ENIAC Programmers\n\n\n\n\nIn the early days of computing, there was a job called being a computer, where women, mostly women, some men, would calculate and compute. During World War II, there was a large need for mathematical solutions (…)\n\nMegan Smith, U.S. Chief of Technology\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}",

    "text": "Kernel vs Shell\nMost operating system are made up of two important parts: - The Kernel - The Shell\n\n\n\nThe Kernel is the core of the operating system\n\n\nThe Kernel is the innermost part of the operating system and it is responsible for controlling the computer hardware components. It interacts with the devices such as the processor, the main memory, the storage devices, the inputs devices, output devices and communcation devices. It talks to the hardware through device drivers (small programs that connect the OS to each device) and keeps the system stable and running smoothly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOS is the Air traffic controller\n\n\n\nYou can think of the OS an air traffic controller at a busy airport. Where the programs running are like the airplanes and the hardware are the gates, runways, various terminals. The traffic controller must carefully coordinate takeoffs and landings, allocating runway space and assigning gates to the various airplanes going through. It’s must avoid collisions!\n\n\n\nThe Shell is the part of the operating system that lets the user interact with its functions. This can be done in two ways:\n\nThrough a Graphical User Interface (GUI) — often called “Gooey” — using windows, icons, and menus.\nThrough a Command-Line Interface (CLI) — by typing commands that the OS understands.\n\nThese typed commands are converted into binary instructions by the command interpreter, so the computer can execute them.\nExamples of command-line shells include:\n\nBash – used in Linux, macOS, and other Unix-based systems\nCmd – used in Windows (used to be MS-DOS)\n\n\n\nProgram, process versus thread\nYou might hear these terms used interchangeably, but they aren’t the same and you’ll learn them in more depth in your Operating Systems course next year.\nA program 📜 is a set of instructions written by a programmer like you. It runs when the operating system loads it into memory. You can have several instances of the same program running at once, each one is a separate process.\nA process ⚙️ is one active instance of a program running in memory (RAM). Each process works independently and has its own memory space. The OS keeps track of them using a unique process ID (PID).\nA thread 🧵 is a smaller unit of work inside a process. Threads let a process perform multiple tasks at the same time, just like CPU threads let the OS run several software threads simultaneously for multitasking. This will not be part of any evaluation in this course, but it’s still useful to understand when you start developing apps and web apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipResturant Analogy\n\n\n\n\nImagine the Operating System as the head chef in a busy restaurant, with several sous-chefs working under him. All the recipes—written 📜 by programmers are stored in a large file cabinet (the storage device).\nWhen a customer orders a cake, the chef (OS) retrieves the recipe, assigns it to a sous-chef, and provides the necessary ingredients, an oven (CPU), and a workspace (RAM) ⚙️\nTo speed things up, the chef can assign assistants to help the sous-chef, each handling smaller tasks in parallel 🧵, all sharing the same resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteActivity - Task manager\n\n\n\nTo observe the various process currently running on your computer, you can open the Task Manager on Windows: 1. Press the Alt + Ctrl + Del 2. Open the Task Manager\nOn a Mac, the equivalent is the Activity Monitor and on Linux it’s the System Monitor (or type the top command to display processes in the Terminal).\nYou’ll probably realize that many programs are actually using multiple processes at the same time!\nSometimes, a process is stalling or not responding. A useful tip is to know how to force it to stop running. 3. Right click the frozen program, click “End Task”\n\n\n\n\nOS and the CPU\nHow the OS speaks to the CPU, RAM and storage is a complex process and is out of scope for this course, but it’s useful to build a mental picture to to tie-in all the knowledge we’ve learned for far.\nAt this stage, you know that the CPU is an incredibly complex network of transistors linked by wires to the RAM. These connections allow the CPU to fetches instructions and data by reading specific addresses and values from memory. It then decodes them using its built-in codebook. The clock determines how often the CPU executes instructions, all happening in binary, where each transistor is either ON (1) or OFF (0).\nWhen a computer boots up, the BIOS (after the POST and hardware initialization) takes control of the CPU, and loads the Operating system. The OS will ten take control of the CPU to perform. When an app/program is launched, the operating system reserves space in RAM and loads the program’s machine code (binary intructions) into that space. It then updates the CPU’s program counter (a special register) to the starting address of the program in memory, this is what starts the execution of a program. In other words, the OS is the true brains of the computer and uses the CPU as its high speed calculator!\nThe OS also frequently switches the CPU’s focus from one program to another, creating the illusion of multitasking. In reality, the CPU is performing rapid task switching, handling one task at a time but so quickly that it feels simultaneous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOrganize this series of events..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOS and RAM\nThe OS’s most important function is to manage the memory (RAM), more specifically it’ll allocate space in the RAM for various programs to run. Before diving into this process, let’s take a look at how memory is organized.\nEvery RAM stick is made of millions of memory cells organized as a matrix as learnt in the hardware module. To read/write to those cells, special circuitry connected to embedded wires called address lines can precisely access each “group” of 8 bits (1 byte) of data.\n\n\n\nHow the memory cells are accessed\n\n\nIf a data value needs more than 8 bits, it spans multiple memory locations. This means that a single value can occupy several addresses. Each unique combination of address bits identifies one specific memory location in RAM. Although addresses are stored in binary, they’re typically shown in hexadecimal for easier reading.\n\n\n\nRepresentation of the memory space, Source: Main Memory by Chemketa College - Computer Science Department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOrganize the RAM\n\n\n\nYou are working under Chef- OS who is trying to organize the following processes, in the various kitchen workstation of 8 bits. Three processes (sous-chefs) are competing for space in the RAM! 1. Process A wants to save the unsigned number 128 2. Process B wants to save the ascii text “Hi” 3. Process C wants to save the color #CCOOCC 4. Process B wants to modify the text to “Hi!”\nAssume that the OS is going to assign space by order of available workstations.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical Memory\nModern CPUs use 64-bit data buses and 64-bit address buses. This means, in theory, a CPU could access up to \\(2^{64}\\) memory locations. If each location stores just 1 byte, that would equal roughly 18 million terabytes (\\(10^{18}\\) bytes) of memory!\nOf course, that’s not the case! Even the most powerful computers today have only a few hundred gigabytes of RAM. The operating system manages this difference by mapping logical addresses (what the programs running on CPU thinks exists) to physical addresses (the actual locations in RAM).\n\n\nVirtual Memory\nVirtual memory or logical memory is an abstraction of the memory location created by the Operating system to give the “illusion” to any program executing on the CPU that there is a lot more memory than there actually is! The job of the OS to map this virutal memory to physical memory and make sure it updates the mapping table.\n\n\n\nVirtual Memory Source: Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtualization\nLet’s return to the restaurant analogy. Imagine the restaurant is completely full, and every bit of workspace is being used by the sous-chefs. New customer orders keep coming in, and Chef-OS needs more room to prepare urgent meals.\nTo make space, the chef notices that some sous-chefs are only prepping ingredients for tomorrow, not cooking right away. So, he decides to move them to the cold storage room at the back to free up tables for the urgent dishes. The sous-chefs set up a small workspace there and continue working, though it’s not ideal!\nIn computing, this is similar to virtual memory or swap space. When the system runs out of RAM, it borrows space from the storage drive to keep processes running. It helps temporarily, but relying on it too much can slow things down — and just like the sous-chefs, your computer won’t like working in those conditions!\n\n\n\nSous-chefs working in the cold room — representing data being moved from RAM to storage. Image Generated by Copilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteQuestion\n\n\n\nAn operating system allocates 1-byte memory blocks for two processes, A and B, running concurrently. The following sequence of events occurs:\n\nProcess B starts and stores the value 1024 in memory.\nProcess A starts and attempts to store the string “HELLO” in memory, but block 3 is already occupied by a third, unknown process.\nProcess B frees some memory space and stores the value 128.\nProcess A appends more text to its initial message, resulting in “HELLO WORLD!”.\n\nAssume each letter is 1 byte and that the OS allocates the memory blocks based on which are currently free. Determine in which order each piece of information will be stored in the physical RAM:\n\n\n\nAddress\nData\n\n\n\n\n0x00\n?\n\n\n0x01\n?\n\n\n0x02\n?\n\n\n\nValidate your answer here\n\n\n\n\nOS and Hardware - summary\nThe OS manages similar interactions with all hardware components.

    "text": "As we saw with Unicode, computers need to handle very large numbers to distinguish between the many possible characters and instructions. While computers work effortlessly with large binary numbers, we don’t! Converting 32-bit or 64-bit values from binary to decimal is tedious, which makes large binary numbers difficult for humans to read and write quickly.\nWe’re comfortable with large decimal numbers, but the problem is that 10 is not a power of 2. This means it doesn’t align neatly with the binary storage model computers rely on. For example, with just 4 bits we can represent values up to 16, but to store something slightly larger, like 17–20, we already need 5 bits.\nThe result is that decimal numbers cannot be directly stored in machines built from transistors that only distinguish between “on” (1) and “off” (0). So what’s the solution? We turn to hexadecimal—a system that maps perfectly onto binary while staying compact and much easier for humans to read and write.\nNotice that 16 is a power of 2: \\(2^4 = 16\\). This means every 4 bits (a nibble) can store one hexadecimal digit (a “hexit”), and with 8 bits we can store two “hexits”.\n\n\nThe hexadecimal system is base 16 🔢. This means we count from 0 to 15 before moving to the next place value. In decimal, we only have the digits 0–9 🔟.

We call binary a base-2 numeral system.\nSo if we have more than 1 of something, another bit is needed:\n\n1 + 1 = 10 (in English: one plus one equals two)\n\n11 + 1 = 100 (in English: three plus one equals four)\n\nIt may feel counterintuitive at first 🤯, but there’s nothing fundamentally different about binary compared to decimal, we’re just more used to working in decimal.\nJust like in decimal addition, when a column reaches its maximum digit (9), we carry over a 1 to the next column (the next power of 10). In binary, the idea is the same, but the largest digit is only 1. So whenever we get 1 + 1 in the same column, we carry over to the next place value (the next power of 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the CPU, special circuits called adder gates handle this process automatically. The sum is the result that stays in the current column, while the carry (C) is the extra 1 that “spills over” into the next column (the next power of 2).\n\n\n\nHalf-Adder gate 1➕1 Adds two single binary digits.\n\n\n\n\n\nFull-Adder 1➕1➕1: Adds two binary digits and includes the carry from a previous addition.",

    "text": "Negative numbers 🌡️\nNot all numbers in real life are positive, just think of freezing winter temperatures in Canada 🥶 or when bank accounts slip below zero ☹️💸. Because of this, computers must be able to represent not only positive values but also negative ones. In binary, special methods are used to handle negative numbers so that calculations remain accurate and efficient.\nHow can be achieve this with a binary system?\n\nSigned Magnitudes ⛰️ Representation\nThe simple answer is to use the first bit of a number to represent the sign and use the remaining bits for the magnitude of the number. This approach for representing numbers is called Signed Magnitudes.\n\n1 for negative ➖\n0 for positive ➕\n\nWith this simple approach however, zero ends up having two representations (positive zero and negative zero), and basic operations are not working as expected, for example: \\[\n5_{10} + −5_{10} = 0101_{2} + 1101_{2} = 0010_{2} \\not = 0_{10}  ❌\n\\]\n\\[\n6_{10} + (-2)_{10} =  0110_{2} + 1010_{2} = 0000_{2} \\not = 4_{10} ❌\n\\]\nHere are the binary values from -7 to +7:\n\n\n\nBinary\nDecimal Value\n\n\n\n\n1 1 1 1\n-7\n\n\n1 1 1 0\n-6\n\n\n1 1 0 1\n-5\n\n\n1 1 0 0\n-4\n\n\n1 0 1 1\n-3\n\n\n1 0 1 0\n-2\n\n\n1 0 0 1\n-1\n\n\n1 0 0 0\n-0 ❓ Negative zero??\n\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 ⚠️ Zero appears twice!\n\n\n0 0 0 1\n1\n\n\n0 0 1 0\n2\n\n\n0 0 1 1\n3\n\n\n0 1 0 0\n4\n\n\n0 1 0 1\n5\n\n\n0 1 1 0\n6\n\n\n0 1 1 1\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo’s complement 2️ Representation\nTwo’s complement is the most common way to represent signed numbers in computers. It’s based on mathematical thoeries and help fix the issues seen above with the “simple approach”.\n\nExample: Representing a negative number using Two’s Complement\n\n✍️ Write the positive version of the number using all the bits available (including one bit for the sign)\n\nExample: (5)10 = (0000 0101)2\n\n🔄 Invert all the bits (flip 0 → 1 and 1 → 0).\n\n0000 0101 → 1111 1010\nThis is also called One’s complement.\n\n➕1 Add 1 to the inverted value.\n\n1111 1010 + 1 = 1111 1011\n\n\n✅ Therefore, (-5)10 = (1111 1011)*2 ​\nHere are the binary representation of numbers from -7 to +7 in two’s complement:\n\n\n\nBinary\nDecimal Value\n\n\n\n\n1 0 0 0\n-8\n\n\n1 0 0 1\n-7\n\n\n1 0 1 0\n-6\n\n\n1 0 1 1\n-5\n\n\n1 1 0 0\n-4\n\n\n1 1 0 1\n-3\n\n\n1 1 1 0\n-2\n\n\n1 1 1 1\n-1\n\n\n0 0 0 0\n0\n\n\n0 0 0 1\n1\n\n\n0 0 1 0\n2\n\n\n0 0 1 1\n3\n\n\n0 1 0 0\n4\n\n\n0 1 0 1\n5\n\n\n0 1 1 0\n6\n\n\n0 1 1 1\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample: Representing (-20)10 in Two’s Complement\n\n\n\n✍️ Step 1: How many bits do we need?\n👉 Rule of thumb: if the leftmost bit is 1, add an extra bit!\n(because negative numbers should always start with 1 , and positive numbers with 0)\n\\[(20)_{10} = (10100)_{2} \\;\\; \\rightarrow \\;\\; (010100)_{2}\\]\n\n🔄 Step 2: Invert all the bits\n\\[\n010100 \\;\\; \\rightarrow \\;\\; 101011\n\\]\n\n➕1 Step 3: Add 1 to the inverted value\n\\[\n101011 + 1 = 101100\n\\]\n\n✅ Final Answer:\n\\[\n(-20)_{10} = (101100)_{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nMath operations in Two’s complement\nNow let’s observe why Two’s complement fixes the simple operations we had earlier:\n🧮 Example 1: \\[\n5_{10} + -5_{10} =  0101_{2} + 1011_{2} = 0000_{2} = 0_{10} ✅\n\\]\n🧮 Example 2: \\[\n6_{10} + -2_{10} =  0110_{2} + 1110_{2} = 0100_{2} = 4_{10} ✅\n\\] 🔄 The overflow that happens with fixed bits ensures that we “wrap around” back to 0 when adding a positive and its negative counterpart.\n💡 Key Advantage:\nUsing Two’s Complement makes math operations simpler for computers ⚡. Both signed and unsigned numbers can be added using the same adder circuits 🔌.\n👉 For example:\n- 4 + 2 (unsigned)\n- 4 + (-2) (signed)\nBoth are handled using the same hardware adder gate ➕.",

Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample caption. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\nData bus 💡💡💡\nIn this analogy this arrangement of light bulbs is called a data bus: a method for transporting data from one component to another using electrical circuits. These “light bulbs”: - can be controlled (turned on or off) by us and by the guy-in-the-box - are synchronized (bulb 1 for us has the same value as bulb 1 for the guy) - we can share messages by setting the light bulbs on off, as long as we: agree on schedule (not changing the lightbulbs at the same time) - the meaning (share the same interpretation of lightbulb being on/off)\n\n\n\nCodebook: Agreeing on meaning 📖\nHow do we share the same meaning?\nIt’s important to have common definitions for the meaning of the lightbulbs being on/off to understand messages sent by this method CPUs are designed with a codebook (instruction set) that defines the commands that we can give to the guy in the box. This codebook is built into each CPU by its manufacturer and is called “machine code”.\n\n\n\nEvery pair of light bulbs is matching and can be controlled from the inside by the CPU or from the outside by the program executing instructions on the CPU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf CPUs only understand machine code (sequence of 1 or 0), how can this C# code be understood by it?\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\"); \n\n\n\n\n\nRegisters\nSo far, we can send/receive “messages” from the light bulbs. But, in order to “remember” a message, the guy needs at least a few workstations ( registers ) to copy our messages, otherwise the messages will be lost every time the data bus updates.\n\nRegisters are places to store a very small amount of data temporarily\nRegisters are usually the around the 1-4x the size of the data bus\nWe can give the registers names to distinguish them (AX, BX, CX, DX for example)\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy of the registers acting as workstations. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAre CPU registers made of the same technology as RAM?\n\n\n\n\n\nClock: Agreeing on schedule ⏰\nNow we are ready to communicate with the guy in the box. We can send them the first command by lighting up the bulbs on the data bus.\nBut how do they know when we have finished setting up the light bulbs?\n\n\n\nClock analogy. Image source: unknown.\n\n\n\nWe can use a bell activated by a button.\nA real computer uses a special wire called the clock wire (CLK). The CLK wire is turned on and off on a precise and regular schedule. This is called a clock cycle.\nEach time the clock turns on, the state of our lightbulbs is shared with the guy in the box\nThe guy then has until the clock turns off to send a message back\nThe next time the clock turns on, a new message is sent to the CPU\nThe time between each clock cycle is the speed that a CPU can perform a given task\nThe maximum number of clock cycles a CPU can handle in given period of time is called the clock speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n\n# Sample Guy in a Box Problem\n\n\nUsing the following codebook, ask the “Guy in a box” to calculate 2+3\n\n\nYou must send a series of commandsto the CPU. The CPU will act on each command and give you an answer.\n\n\nYour answer should be a sequence of numbers you could send to the guy in the box to get the right answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n10000000  The next line is a number, put it in AX\n00000010  The number 2\n10010000  The next line is a number, put it in BX\n00000011  The number 3\n10110000  Add AX to BX and put the result in AX\n11000000  Place the value of AX on the external data bus\nA set of commands such as this is called a program.

Here are a few common instructions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstruction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nLOAD\nLoad this value from RAM\n\n\nADD\nAdd these two numbers\n\n\nSTORE\nSave this value to RAM\n\n\nCOMPARE\nCompare these two numbers\n\n\nJUMP IF\nIf a condition is true, jump to this next set of instructions (example : if statement)\n\n\nJUMP\nJump to this next set of instructions (without any conditions - example function call)\n\n\nIN\nRead data from the input device (example keyboard)\n\n\nOUT\nSend data to an output device (example printer)\n\n\n\nAll this information, the instruction, the location of the hardware devices are all in binary (machine code)! When you write a program in C#, Java, Python, etc. You are programming in high level programming language that will be compiled into machine code by the compiler of this language (or interpreted by the interpreter of this language).\n\n\n\nIllustration of CPU wiring to the RAM. Image source: Figure from In One Lesson on Youtube (excellent video explaination on CPUs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighway analogy: clock Speed vs bus width\n\nYou can double check that you understand a scientific concept by checking what units of measurement that concept is measured by:\nHighway\n\nNumber of lanes: (a number)\nSpeed limit: (unit distance per time elapsed, e.g. km/h)\n\nSystem bus\n\nBus width:  (a number of bits, eg a 32-bit processor)\nBus speed:  (unit information per time elapsed, e.g. bits/second)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalogy of the highway.

Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card.

Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.\n\n\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).1\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction.2\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.\n\n\nHardware: The physical components that make up a computer system.\nSoftware: The programs (instructions) that tell the computer (the hardware) what to do.\n\n\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.\n\n\nNone for this lecture – stay tuned for the next two lectures!\n\n\nThe following questions invite you to reflect on the key information learned in this lesson. If you can’t answer the question, you can click the corresponding link to review the topic more closely. Future assignments and tests may be based on questions like these:\n\nWhat are the two main properites of computers?\nAre video game consoles computers?\nAre there examples of nonelectonic computers? How do nonelectronic computer compute?\nWhy is binary relevant to computers?\nWhat is the property of computers that means they reliably behave the same way given the same input?\nWhat is the name for the type of computer that is always on, and is specialized for processing large amounts of data and pooling many computing resources in one place?\n\n\n\nThis section contains helpful links to related content. You aren’t required to study these in detail, but it never hurts to learn more.\n\nComputer Basics by GCF Global: We will eventually cover almost all of the material in this free online resource; for now, Parts 1-7 in particular are relevant to what we have learned so far.\n“The Mother of All Demos” This is a 1968 presentation that introduced many of the hardware/graphics concepts we will see today and some we will see in future lectures: the mouse, networking, video conferencing, word documents, hyperlinks, gamer headphones, etc. It is very cool to see the palpable excitement of the 2000+ audience tuning into a passionate presentation of a series of completely new technologies.\nMontréal’s Musée de l’Ordinateur – unfortunately the physical location has been closed since 2022, but the website is still a neat resource for reading on the history of personal computers and their evolution. The author’s bias towards Bill Gates and Windows machines is quite strong (there is much more to the story), but the information provided is reliable and interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese digital states are made possible using electrical circuitry. In order to do complex operations with these states, we can use the binary numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters, and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)For one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you don’t). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices reliably and predictably produce the same deterministic results under the same physical conditions."

In order to do complex operations with these states, we can use the binary numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters, and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)↩︎\nFor one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you don’t). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices reliably and predictably produce the same deterministic results under the same physical conditions.↩︎",

Exam easy or hard?\nThe first section of students of Tech Support collectively decided not to study for their mid-term exam and instead build a truth table to predict if the exam will be easy or hard based on their teacher’s mood.\nThey built a logic gate diagram, where the output is a light bulb. If it turns on, the exam will be easy, and everyone passes.\nThey have four switches that can turn on/off independently. The first switch represents if the weather is above 0 degrees Celsius in Canada. The second switch represents if it’s snowing outside (negative temperatures). The third switch represents if the exam is happening on a Thursday and the last switch represents if the exam is happening on a Friday.\n\n\nLet’s imagine it is snowing on Exam Day.

You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother.\nLearning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school\n\nIf you feel more advanced or have already done what’s shown in class, don’t hesitate to help others and share your knowledge with the class.\nSeek out help if you are struggling (from me, from peers, from John Abbott student services, etc.)\n\n\n\n\n5: Be curious!\nThis field has a lot of support online.
