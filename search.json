    "text": "Output Devices\nOutput Devices are devices that present data and information to the user from a computer.\n\nMonitors\nThere are many different types of monitors use different technologies to create an image. However, the common principles are the same:\n\nDigital representation of image to display is sent to the monitor\nThe monitor produces each pixel (the “atom” of monitor displays) using some deterministic physical technology\nLight from the monitor reaches us as a useful/pleasing image.\n\nThe following sections are the main technologies used today (from oldest to newest)\n\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT)\nCathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors are very complicated, very cool, moderately dangerous, and mostly obsolete!\n\nThe most common type of consumer and industry television before ~2010\nBasically: a tungsten coil is heated in a vacuum until it sheds electrons, those electrons are accelerated by an electric field and guided by magnets to hit a phosphor coated glass display to emit light in a pixel grid\nObsolete since today their are lighter, simpler higher resolution technologies\nStill used today for some applications due to zero latency . For instance, I use one for playing NES Tetris!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma\nPlasma monitors use tiny cells of ionised gas that light up when stimulated by electricity.\n\nOften used in home theatre applications due to accurate video representation.\nHigh levels of brightness, deep black levels and very wide colour range.\nHave shorter life span, susceptible to “screen burn-in” (this is why screensavers are called “screen savers”! Same for CRT).\n(+) Plasma cell will produce light that looks good from every angle, it was high refresh rate (videos are smoother)\n(-) BUT! Consumes a lot of electricity\n(-) Doesn’t work at high altitudes! (low pressure)\n\n\n\n\nPlasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge). Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)\n\n\n\n\nLiquid Crystal Display (LCD)\nAn LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. Liquid cystal is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion). This technology allows for precise control of color without the need to ionise gas with powerful electronics.\n\nCommonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.\nConsists of a white backlight (in light, white = all colours combined), two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution between them to transform the backlight into a coherent pixel grid.\nAn electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.\n(+) Allow the use of flat screens!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through. To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face ( made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green)\n\n\n\n\nLight emitting diode (LED)\n\nAn LCD display that uses LED backlighting instead of a white backlight to light the display. The brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel\n(+) Thinner (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast\n(+) Lower power  consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\nFor more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx-JVoOFYhs&ab_channel=e-learning%C3%A9lectronique\n\n\nOrganic LED (OLED)\nOLED displays are similar to LED, but no backlighting required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied.\n\nSimilar to LED, but no backlighting  required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied .\n(+) Allows for perfect representation of dark colors  unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors\n(-) More expensive to produce, more susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)\n\nHere’s a great video (8 mins) explaining both physical and software technologies required to make the above monitors work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyLDA9QT8EY\nWith LCD, LED, and OLED, we finally get to the most modern monitor technologies. These are used in our labs, most computers, laptops. They’re ordered here approximately in order of lowest (LCD) -&gt; highest (OLED) quality, though pros and cons exist for each.\nSee here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays.\n\n\n\n\nPrinters\nPrinters take data from a computer and generate output on paper: Basic principles\n\nSimilar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)\nRather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper. The physical setup is different, but the same principles are at work.\n\n\n\n\nA high enough quantity of toasted bread produces the qualitative impression of a human eye in this “piece” of art. Printers (and monitors) use much higher quantities of “pixels” than depicted here!\n\n\n\nDot-matrix printers\n\nUses print heads containing pins which produce patterns of dots on the paper by mechanical impact (pressing).\nInexpensive and typically print at a speed of 100 - 600 characters per second.\n(Optional) See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer for more detail on history and technology\nWhile still in use for particular applications (printing receipts for e.g.), these are now obsoleted by…\n\n\n\nInk-jet printers\n\nUses tiny droplets of ink to produce images.\nHeat is applied to an ink reservoir, which pushes ink bubbles through a nozzle in a controlled manner.\nThe ink liquid droplets are smaller in diameter than a human hair! Many of these added together produce the quality of a coherent image.\nQuieter than dot-matrix, and also provide better speed and higher quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk-based color printer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk jet cartridge operation. Image source: youtube.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaser Printers\n\nExpensive when they were initially introduced.\nProduce high-quality output quietly at a high speed.\nProduces images by directing a laser beam at a mirror which bounces the beam onto a drum.\n\nThe drum contains a special coating to which the toner (ink powder) sticks.\nA laser beam then conveys information to the drum, neutralizing and detaching some toner.\nAs the paper rolls by the drum, the toner is transferred onto the paper. A hot roller then bonds toner to the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.",

Back in the day, mice/keyboards/external storage/speakers/etc. all had different cables. These have now been (mostly) unified under the USB standard.\nUSB connectors can transmit both power (e.g. charging phones) and information (data). Despite being “Universal” there are an incredible number of USB types.\n\nUSB “Number” standards refer to the transmission speed and power of the cables\n\ne.g. USB 3 is faster/more power than USB 2 and USB 2\n\nUSB “Letter” standards refer to the physical design of the connector and the port\n\ne.g. USB C and USB A are incompatible interfaces, cannot be interchanged.\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer standards are backwards compatible (e.g. USB 3.1 cable works in USB 1.1 port at USB 1.1 speed/power)\n\n\n\n\nAudio\nMost commonly the standard headphone jack (TSR connector). Available in several sizes, most commonly 3.5mm or ⅛” mini audio jack. Can be color coded - microphone (pink), speaker (green).\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\nFor higher-end audio, we can use fiberoptic cables as these can transmit larger amounts of data more quickly, which is required for producing a high-quality audio signal.\n\n\nVideo\nVGA cable is commonly used for computer monitors (15-pins). Low resolutions, now obsolete. There exist converter cables to connect VGA monitors to newer computers.\nMiniVGA is a variant found on laptops.\nDVI was once the common modern upgrade from VGA, capable of higher resolutions. MiniDVI and MicroDVI on “thin” laptops.\nS-Video commonly used for DVD players, camcorders and older consoles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVGA, DVI, and RCA cables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDVI. Can be distinguished from VGA by noticing that it is a much wider interface with many more pins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS-video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converter from mini-DP to three possible outputs: DP, DVI, and HDMI\n\n\n\n\n\nRCA cables include composite video (yellow) and stereo audio cables (red for right; white/black for left). Component video offers a better picture.\nHDMI is the new standard for audio and video transmission in a single cable.\nDisplayPort (and Mini DisplayPort) more commonly used in computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure caption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\neSATA is used internally to connect the hard drive to the motherboard but can also be used for portable hard drives.\n\n\n\nNetworking\nTelephone cable (RJ11) used for connecting to the internet through DSL/ADSL modems. Standard phone cable has 4 wires; connector has 4 pins. Clip helps to maintain tight connection.\nEthernet (RJ45) is the standard for wired networking. Based on Cat5 twisted pair cable, made from 8 individual wires. Connector looks similar to phone plug but is thicker and wider. Also uses a clip to maintain tight connection.",

My course notes are not a substitute for regular class attendance. Hands on experience is key!\nNote: All of your marks come from Assignments and Tests. We will do in-class activities that are neither Assignments or Tests, but are required – completing the in-class labs will be a component of your Assignment mark. If you finish in-class labs quickly, you will have more time to work on Assignments in class, instead of at home.\n\n\nRule 2: Consult the Support Material\n\nClass Slides\nLab and exercises in class\nAssignments\nYour class notes\n\n\n\nRule 3: Use a calendar to track all your deadlines\n\nTo stay on track for all your deadlines, try to plan one or two weeks ahead!\nComplete your assignments on time\n\nBut! Endeavour to at least hand in assignments. Better late/incomplete than never.\n\nIf you miss a deadline, please don’t ignore it!\n\nMIO me. I’m here to help! And that includes for late/incomplete assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRule 4: Reach out for help!\n\nReach out to me if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed\nTry your best to get to know other students\n\nHelp each other out! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother than you will from listening to me\nLearning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school\n\nSeek out help if you are struggling (from me, from peers, from John Abbott student services, etc.)\n\n\n\nRule 5: Be curious!\nThis field has a lot of support online.

What is it that computers actually do? This lecture is a brief introduction to these questions. The big picture definitions we learn here will be helpful anchors for better understanding the more complicated and detailed components of modern computers that we will need to learn to understand technical support as a science and a profession."

    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesNonelectronics?Computers within computers?\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Video game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card. Images by aerozol from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven before there were consumer electronics, there were devices made to store and process data – that is, computers! The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots. Image by Pearson Scott Foresman, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntikythera mechanism fragment, dated to 80 BCE. Thought to have been part of a complex system of dozens of wheels and plates, designed by engineers to measure time based on movements of the sun, moon, and other stars and planets known at the time. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine diagram. A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles."

In fact, it can be said that computers, or computing devices, have been part of human society (in some manner or another) for centuries – even though the computers we typically think of today are relatively recent inventions from the 20th century.\nWhat is a computer? What is it that computers actually do? This lecture is a brief introduction to these questions. The big picture definitions we learn here will be helpful anchors for better understanding the more complicated and detailed components of modern computers that we will need to learn to understand technical support as a science and a profession.",

    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesNonelectronics?Computers within computers?\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Video game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card. Images by aerozol from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven before there were consumer electronics, there were devices made to store and process data – that is, computers! The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots. Image by Pearson Scott Foresman, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntikythera mechanism fragment, dated to 80 BCE. Thought to have been part of a complex system of dozens of wheels and plates, designed by engineers to measure time based on movements of the sun, moon, and other stars and planets known at the time. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine diagram. A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.",
