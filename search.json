In fact, it can be said that computers, or computing devices, have been part of human society (in some manner or another) for centuries – even though the computers we typically think of today are relatively recent inventions from the 20th century.\nWhat is a computer? What is it that computers actually do? This lecture is a brief introduction to these questions. The big picture definitions we learn here will be helpful anchors for better understanding the more complicated and detailed components of modern computers that we will need to learn to understand technical support as a science and a profession.",

    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesNonelectronics?Computers within computers?\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Video game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card.

Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.",

    "text": "Digital computers\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF). These digital states are made possible using electrical circuitry. In order to do complex operations with these states, we can use the binary numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters, and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction. For one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you don’t). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices reliably and predictably produce the same deterministic results under the same physical stimuli.\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.",

    "text": "Personal vs shared computing: What is a server?\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.",

We will do in-class activities that are neither Assignments or Tests, but are required – completing the in-class labs will be a component of your Assignment mark. If you finish in-class labs quickly, you will have more time to work on Assignments in class, instead of at home.\n\n\nRule 2: Consult the Support Material\n\nClass Slides\nLab and exercises in class\nAssignments\nYour class notes\n\n\n\nRule 3: Use a calendar to track all your deadlines\n\nTo stay on track for all your deadlines, try to plan one or two weeks ahead!\nComplete your assignments on time\n\nBut! Endeavour to at least hand in assignments. Better late/incomplete than never.\n\nIf you miss a deadline, please don’t ignore it!\n\nMIO me. I’m here to help! And that includes for late/incomplete assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\nRule 4: Reach out for help!\n\nReach out to me if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed\nTry your best to get to know other students\n\nHelp each other out! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother than you will from listening to me\nLearning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school\n\nSeek out help if you are struggling (from me, from peers, from John Abbott student services, etc.)\n\n\n\nRule 5: Be curious!\nThis field has a lot of support online.
