    "section": "Is this a computer? Examples",
    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card. Images by aerozol from Pixabay. :::\n\n\nNonelectronics?\nEven before there were consumer electronics, there were devices made to store and process data – that is, computers! The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots. Image by Pearson Scott Foresman, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntikythera mechanism fragment, dated to 80 BCE. Thought to have been part of a complex system of dozens of wheels and plates, designed by engineers to measure time based on movements of the sun, moon, and other stars and planets known at the time. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine diagram. A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers within computers?\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.\n\n\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).1\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction.2\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.\n\n\nHardware: The physical components that make up a computer system.\nSoftware: The programs (instructions) that tell the computer (the hardware) what to do.\n\n\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.\n\n\nNone for this lecture – stay tuned for the next two lectures!\n\n\nThe following questions invite you to reflect on the key information learned in this lesson. If you can’t answer the question, you can click the corresponding link to review the topic more closely. Future assignments and tests may be based on questions like these:\n\nWhat are the two main properites of computers?\nAre video game consoles computers?\nAre there examples of nonelectonic computers? How do nonelectronic computer compute?\nWhy is binary relevant to computers?\nWhat is the property of computers that means they reliably behave the same way given the same input?\nWhat is the name for the type of computer that is always on, and is specialized for processing large amounts of data and pooling many computing resources in one place?\n\n\n\nThis section contains helpful links to related content. You aren’t required to study these in detail, but it never hurts to learn more.\n\nComputer Basics by GCF Global: We will eventually cover almost all of the material in this free online resource; for now, Parts 1-7 in particular are relevant to what we have learned so far.\n“The Mother of All Demos” This is a 1968 presentation that introduced many of the hardware/graphics concepts we will see today and some we will see in future lectures: the mouse, networking, video conferencing, word documents, hyperlinks, gamer headphones, etc. It is very cool to see the palpable excitement of the 2000+ audience tuning into a passionate presentation of a series of completely new technologies.\nMontréal’s Musée de l’Ordinateur – unfortunately the physical location has been closed since 2022, but the website is still a neat resource for reading on the history of personal computers and their evolution. The author’s bias towards Bill Gates and Windows machines is quite strong (there is much more to the story), but the information provided is reliable and interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese digital states are made possible using electrical circuitry. In order to do complex operations with these states, we can use the binary numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters, and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)For one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you don’t). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices reliably and predictably produce the same deterministic results under the same physical conditions."

    "text": "Is this a computer? Examples\nThe above definition sounds pretty general – and it is! What kinds of things count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to compute things.\n\nDesktopsLaptopsMobile PhonesGame consolesDigital computersHardware vs SoftwarePersonal vs shared computing: What is a server?ExercisesKnowledge checkAdditional resources\n\n\nDesktop computers, often referred to as the Personal Computer (PC), are a classic example of a modern computing device – these are the computers that we will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our study this semester.\nDesktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply: (1) information is stored in disks, and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like keyboards and mice, and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA desktop computer is composed of external (peripheral) components like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as internal (system) components that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe. Image by OpenClipart-Vectors from Pixabay.\n\n\nWe will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.\n\n\nLaptop computers meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as desktop computers: (1) information is stored in disks (usually smaller in size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human interaction using devices like embedded keyboards and trackpads – though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in – and then modified by the computer using a central processing unit (CPU).\n\n\n\nA laptop computer combines similar external/internal components from desktop computers into one portable container. While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components. Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\nThe first mobile phones were computers in a much more limited sense than desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones – but nonetheless they could store data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small memory cards, as well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for calling and texting.\nSmartphones are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications, run operating systems, and much more.\n\n\n\nTwo decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first “smartphones” of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s. Image from Wikipedia, image by Jojhnjoy - own work, based on the work of Anders, Public Domain\n\n\n\n\nGame consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but generally manufactured from proprietary hardware that cannot be interchanged with other computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo game consoles showed an interesting development in storage technology in the elate 90’s: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a writable ROM game cartridge as in the N64 (left). The next generation of systems like Gamecube (right) would provide read-only game data on a CD-ROM disk with writable data being stored on a separate memory card.

The following are three different examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbacus: The world’s first calculator. Large numbers can be represented using a relatively small number of beads. Simple operations like addition and subtraction are simple to perform, but abacuses are even capable of more complex operations like multiplication, division, and square roots. Image by Pearson Scott Foresman, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntikythera mechanism fragment, dated to 80 BCE. Thought to have been part of a complex system of dozens of wheels and plates, designed by engineers to measure time based on movements of the sun, moon, and other stars and planets known at the time. Retrieved from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine diagram. A theoretical computer designed in the 19th century with capabilities similar to modern computers, but using a complex system of gears and pistons to store and process data, rather than small electronic components. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference engine implemented and built in 2002 based on the original designs. Image retreived from Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers within computers?\nIt is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers inside other computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Video from Codeolences on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nThe above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense. Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights… these are just some of the many devices that work based on computing principles.\n\n\nYou may think the above definition is too general – indeed, in the context of this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about digital computers when we say computer. What is the difference?\nDigital computers have the following two additional properties compared to general computers. They are:\n\nDigital: All the “information” stored is represented by combinations of two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).1\nDeterministic: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every interaction.2\n\nWhen we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow us to really understand how such devices work and why, as in every case, the device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.\n\n\nHardware: The physical components that make up a computer system.\nSoftware: The programs (instructions) that tell the computer (the hardware) what to do.\n\n\nIn the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in modern society – we will also need to learn about how many computers can be combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in technical support as a profession.\nFor now, we can just know that servers are similar to personal computers, but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing large amounts of data.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matthieu Beaumont on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is because servers are the necessary infrastructure for running the large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis: Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on servers, or on collections of servers, known as server farms.\n\n\nNone for this lecture – stay tuned for the next two lectures!\n\n\nThe following questions invite you to reflect on the key information learned in this lesson. If you can’t answer the question, you can click the corresponding link to review the topic more closely. Future assignments and tests may be based on questions like these:\n\nWhat are the two main properites of computers?\nAre video game consoles computers?\nAre there examples of nonelectonic computers? How do nonelectronic computer compute?\nWhy is binary relevant to computers?\nWhat is the property of computers that means they reliably behave the same way given the same input?\nWhat is the name for the type of computer that is always on, and is specialized for processing large amounts of data and pooling many computing resources in one place?\n\n\n\nThis section contains helpful links to related content. You aren’t required to study these in detail, but it never hurts to learn more.\n\nComputer Basics by GCF Global: We will eventually cover almost all of the material in this free online resource; for now, Parts 1-7 in particular are relevant to what we have learned so far.\n“The Mother of All Demos” This is a 1968 presentation that introduced many of the hardware/graphics concepts we will see today and some we will see in future lectures: the mouse, networking, video conferencing, word documents, hyperlinks, gamer headphones, etc. It is very cool to see the palpable excitement of the 2000+ audience tuning into a passionate presentation of a series of completely new technologies.\nMontréal’s Musée de l’Ordinateur – unfortunately the physical location has been closed since 2022, but the website is still a neat resource for reading on the history of personal computers and their evolution. The author’s bias towards Bill Gates and Windows machines is quite strong (there is much more to the story), but the information provided is reliable and interesting.",

In order to do complex operations with these states, we can use the binary numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters, and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)↩︎\nFor one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you don’t). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices reliably and predictably produce the same deterministic results under the same physical conditions.↩︎",

Liquid cystal is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion). This technology allows for precise control of color without the need to ionise gas with powerful electronics.\n\nCommonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.\nConsists of a white backlight, two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution.\nAn electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.\n\nPros\n\nAllow the use of flat screens!\n\nCons\n\nDue to the backlight, black screens are never perfectly black! It always lets some light pass through.\nBecause of the polarizing filters, different viewing angles impact heavily the appearance of the image.\nSomewhat inefficient due to the many layers reducing the brightness of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through. An LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. The projector beam will emit white light which contains all wavelengths. Liquid crystal is a molecule between liquid and crytal state (ordered vs unordered) which has the characteristics of changing orientation under specific voltage. This allows for a precise control of the passage of light. To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face - made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green). This video provides a full explanation\n\n\n\n\nLight emitting diode (LED)\n\nAn LCD display that uses LED backlighting instead of a white backlight to light the display. It still uses Liquid crystals (LCD technology). The brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel.\n\nPros\n\nThinner (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast\nLower power  consumption.\nBetter representation of blacks (compared to original LCDs)\nImproved color filters using quantum dots, which creates vibrant colors.\nHave become the most affordable types of Monitors.\nLEDs backlight lasts for very long making them less susceptible to burn-in compared to OLED screens.\n\nCons\n\nNot yet a perfect representation of black!\nThe individual light diodes level of light is not controlled, it’s still requires liquid crystals to modulate the light.\nThis means that polarized light is still used reducing the viewing angles compared to OLED screens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLED Grid used for backlighting of each individual pixel. -\n\n\n\n\nOrganic LED (OLED)\nOLED displays are similar to LED, but no backlighting required – the organic material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied.\n\nSimilar to LED, but no backlighting required – the material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied .\n\nPros\n\nAllows for perfect representation of dark colors unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive to produce\nMore susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)\n\nHere’s a great video (8 mins) explaining both physical and software technologies required to make the above monitors work.\nWith LCD, LED, and OLED, we finally get to the most modern monitor technologies. These are used in our labs, most computers, laptops. They’re ordered here approximately in order of lowest (LCD) -&gt; highest (OLED) quality, though pros and cons exist for each.\nSee here for more information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays.\n\n\nDisplay Technologies Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nPlasma\nLCD (CCFL backlight)\nLED (LCD with LED backlight)\nOLED\n\n\n\n\nLight Source\nIonized gases excite phosphors (self-light)\nCold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFL) backlight\nLight Emitting Diodes (LED) backlight\nSelf-emitting organic pixels (no backlight)\n\n\nThickness\nBulky, heavy\nThicker than LED\nThinner, lighter than LCD\nUltra-thin, even flexible\n\n\nBrightness\nHigh, but reflective in bright rooms\nModerate\nHigh, adjustable\nHigh, but may degrade over time\n\n\nContrast Ratio\nVery good (deep blacks, but not infinite)\nLower (backlight bleed)\nBetter than LCD, especially with local dimming\nExcellent (true blacks, infinite contrast)\n\n\nViewing Angles\nVery wide\nLimited\nBetter than LCD but not as good as Plasma/OLED\nExcellent, wide and consistent\n\n\nColor Accuracy\nVivid, rich colors\nGood, but limited by backlight\nBetter than LCD\nExcellent, most accurate and vibrant\n\n\nRefresh Rates\nVery fast (good for motion, sports)\nSlower\nFaster than LCD\nVery fast\n\n\nPower Use\nHigh (power-hungry, generates heat)\nHigher than LED\nLower (more efficient than LCD & Plasma)\nEfficient for dark scenes; higher on full bright screen\n\n\nBurn-in Risk\nHigh\nVery low\nVery low\nMedium (improved but possible)\n\n\nLifespan\nShorter (phosphors fade)\nLong\nLong\nMedium to long (organic material degrades)\n\n\nPrice\nExpensive (when available)\nCheapest\nMid-range\nMost expensive\n\n\nCurrent Status\nObsolete (no longer made)\nRare now, replaced by LED\nMost common today\nPremium, used in high-end TVs, monitors, smartphones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinters\nPrinters take data from a computer and generate output on paper: Basic principles\n\nSimilar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)\nRather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper. The physical setup is different, but the same principles are at work.\n\n\n\n\nA high enough quantity of toasted bread produces the qualitative impression of a human eye in this “piece” of art.

Very fast! (speed of light in glass).\n\nA short paper (5 pages) comparing the two cable technologies in more detail: Fibre Optics vs Copper Cabling: Understanding the Differences\n\n\n\nAnalog versus Digital signal cables\n\nAnalog cables carry a continuous and fluctuating electrical signal representing the original penomena (example sound waves).\nDigital cables transmit a binary discrete (sequence of 1 or 0)\n\n\n\nUSB\nUniversal Serial Bus (we’ll talk about the meaning of the last two words soon!) is used to connect most modern devices to computers. Back in the day, mice/keyboards/external storage/speakers/etc. all had different cables. These have now been (mostly) unified under the USB standard.\nUSB connectors can transmit both power (e.g. charging phones) and information (data). Despite being “Universal” there are an incredible number of USB types.\n\nUSB “Number” standards refer to the transmission speed and power of the cables\n\ne.g. USB 3 is faster/more power than USB 2 and USB 2\n\nUSB “Letter” standards refer to the physical design of the connector and the port\n\ne.g. USB C and USB A are incompatible interfaces, cannot be interchanged.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent types of USB standards.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewer standards are backwards compatible (e.g. USB 3.1 cable works in USB 1.1 port at USB 1.1 speed/power)\n\n\n\n\nAudio\nMost commonly the standard headphone jack (TSR connector). Available in several sizes, most commonly 3.5mm or ⅛” mini audio jack. Can be color coded - microphone (pink), speaker (green).\n\n\n\nVarious sizes of TSR connector (headphone jack)\n\n\nFor higher-end audio, we can use fiberoptic cables as these can transmit larger amounts of data more quickly, which is required for producing a high-quality audio signal.\n\n\nVideo\nVGA cable is analog signal cable used for computer monitors. It had 15 pins arranged in 3 rows. It’s a low resolution cable and now obsolete. There exist converter cables to connect VGA monitors to newer computers.\nMiniVGA is a variant found on laptops.\nDVI cabe is analog/digital upgrade from VGA, capable of higher resolutions. It isn’t used as much today.MiniDVI and MicroDVI on “thin” laptops.\nS-Video commonly used for DVD players, camcorders and older consoles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVGA, DVI, and RCA cables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDVI. Can be distinguished from VGA by noticing that it is a much wider interface with many more pins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS-video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA converter from mini-DP to three possible outputs: DP, DVI, and HDMI\n\n\n\n\n\nRCA cables include composite video (yellow) and stereo audio cables (red for right; white/black for left). It’s mainly an analog cable. Component video offers a better picture.\nHDMI is the new standard for audio and video transmission in a single cable.

Standard phone cable has 4 wires; connector has 4 pins. Clip helps to maintain tight connection.\nEthernet (RJ45) is the standard for wired networking. Based on Cat5 twisted pair cable, made from 8 individual wires. Connector looks similar to phone plug but is thicker and wider.
