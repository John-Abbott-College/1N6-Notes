# Classroom Policies & Student Success

---

Lecture notes go here

# How to excel in this course?

* Test 1: 20% \(Week 7\-8\)
* Test 2: 20%  \(Week 14\-15\)
* Assignments and Labs \(60%\)
  * 4 assignements \(15% each\) – every 2\-3 weeks
  * 5 or more Labs will be done\, your attendance is mandatory\!

# Rule 1: Attend all classes and labs!

I will freely provide my slides and as many course resources as necessary to supplement this class\.

But\! My course notes are not a substitute for regular class attendance\. Hands on experience is key\!

![](_assets/Lecture%200%20-%20Course%20Introduction12.jpg)

# Rule 2: Consult the Support Material

* Class Slides \(available on Léa\)
* Lab and exercises in class
* Assignments
* Your class notes
* Other:
  * Handouts
  * Suggested reading material
  * Suggested textbooks

![](_assets/Lecture%200%20-%20Course%20Introduction13.jpg)

# Rule 3: Use a calendar to track all your deadlines

* To stay on track for all your deadlines\, try to plan one or two weeks ahead\!
* Complete your assignments on time
  * But\! Endeavour to at least hand in assignments\. Better late/incomplete than never\.
* If you miss a deadline\, please don't ignore it\!
  * MIO me\. I’m here to help\! And that includes for late/incomplete assignments\.

![](_assets/Lecture%200%20-%20Course%20Introduction14.png)

# Rule 4: Reach out for help!

* Reach out to me if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed
* Try your best to get to know other students\!
  * Help each other out\! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother than you will from listening to me
  * And\, building relationships with new peers is\, in my opinion\, the best part of school
* Seek out help if you are struggling \(from me\, from peers\, from John Abbott student services\, etc\.\)

![](_assets/Lecture%200%20-%20Course%20Introduction15.jpg)

# Rule 5: Be curious!

This field has a lot of support online\, videos and more\!

Stay curious\, the Internet is your Oyster\!
