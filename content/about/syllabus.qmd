Topics include installing, configuring, and uninstalling hardware devices and device drivers, installing and uninstalling system and application software, backing up and restoring software, hard disk partitioning and formatting, help desk, user training.

### What topics does this course cover?

## Rules and tips to succeed in this course

### 1: Attend all classes and labs!

* I take attendance every class and require you to submit in-class activities and group work during class time. 
* This course contains a lot of hands-on learning.
* You CANNOT rely solely on the course notes to succeed.

### 2: Keep a professional behaviour in the lab.

* Arrive to the labs 5 minutes in advance!
* Be careful when handling computer parts, they can easily break.
* Avoid eating or drinking near computers to prevent spills and damage.
* Letâ€™s work together to keep our tech tools in top shape.
* Keep voices low during lab/group activities to avoid distracting others who are working or receiving help.

### 3: Don't play video games in class!

* No video games, or online videos should be played in class.
* If you are done the in-class activities or are waiting after me, you may either leave or work on homework.

### 4: Share with others\!
* Try your best to get to know other students
  * Help each other out! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother.
  * Learning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school
* If you feel more advanced or have already done what's shown in class, don't hesitate to help others and share your knowledge with the class.
* Seek out help if you are struggling \(from me\, from peers\, from John Abbott student services\, etc\.\)
