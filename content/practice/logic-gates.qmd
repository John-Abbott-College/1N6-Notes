# 1. Logic gates 

On the left is the input to a series of logical circuits.  
Indicate the resulting output on the right (1 = on, 0 = off) as well as the intermediate binary values at the exit of each gate:

 Logic Gates | Intermediate value |Output (1 or 0)?|

# 4. Half adders and Full adders

We have seen the half adder logical circuit in class, but we haven’t actually seen why it’s called a half adder. Consider this, if you are trying to add two numbers in a row such as 1 +1 +1. If you try putting two half adder circuits in a row, you will have a problem! 
The output of one gate would have a sum and a carry, we need to have three inputs in the following gate to perform the following addition! That’s when the full comes in handy:


Fill out the truth table of the full adder:

|       |       |         |       |          |

# 5. Exam easy or hard?
The first section of students of Tech Support collectively decided not to study for their mid-term exam and instead build a truth table to predict if the exam will be easy or hard based on their teacher’s mood. 

They built a logic gate diagram, where the output is a light bulb. If it turns on, the exam will be easy, and everyone passes.

They have four switches that can turn on/off independently. The first switch represents if the weather is above 0 degrees Celsius in Canada. The second switch represents if it’s snowing outside (negative temperatures). The third switch represents if the exam is happening on a Thursday and the last switch represents if the exam is happening on a Friday.

1. Let’s imagine it is snowing on Exam Day. Build a truth table.

> Hint: Observe the inputs and the gates well. You do not need to try all possibilities.

2. Let’s imagine it is not snowing on the Exam Day. Build a truth table for all possibilities.

3. One of the inputs seems to not affect the output, which one is it?

4. Simplify the logic circuit be removing this gate.
