## Introduction

Last week we learned the basic behaviors that define *computers* -- their ability to **store, retrieve, and process** information. This means that many simple devices, even non-electronics, can be considered computers.

The computers that we mostly are concerned with in the computer science profession, however, are generally complicated electronic devices made of many **components**. In this class, we are going to learn many of the fundamental components that make up modern computing devices.

Today, we will start with the **external**, or **peripheral**, components of a computer -- each of these have their own set of interesting **behaviors** and **properties** that are worth understanding.

Many **peripheral components** of a computer can broadly be divided into two categories:

- **Input Devices**: devices that *accept* data and instructions *from* a user *to* a computer.
- **Output Devices**: devices that *present* data and information *to* the user *from* a computer.

We will cover many examples of each.

## Lesson overview

Learn the history, behavior, and important properties of Input and Output devices

* Input devices:
  * Keyboards
  * Mice
  * Controllers
  * Cameras
  * Touchscreens
  * Scanners
* Output devices:
  * Monitors
  * Projectors
  * Printers
  * Speakers

## Input Devices

**Input Devices** are devices that *accept* data and instructions *from* a user *to* a computer.

### Mouse

Used to navigate the graphical user interface (GUI). There are many types of mice, distinguished by tracking technology and by use case

__Technology__:

- Mechanical mice use a ball to measure movement (obsolete now -- why?)
- Optical mice use light sources (such as LED, or more precise Laser).[^1]
- LED mice will often have a visible red light and require a non-glossy surface to properly work. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAaESb4wTCM)'s an detailed explanation on how they work.   
- Laser mice provide  higher precision and sensitivity, detecting fine movements and can work on any surface including glass surfaces. However, they are susceptible to sensor acceleration, which causes inconsistent cursor movements based on the speed of movement.

[^1]: Good notes on history and explanation of how/why they work “Optical mice use image sensors to image naturally occurring texture [on the surface they are placed]…. These surfaces, when lit at a grazing angle by a light emitting diode, cast distinct shadows that resemble a hilly terrain lit at sunset. Images of these surfaces are captured in continuous succession and compared with each other to determine how far the mouse has moved.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_mouse https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_mouse

__Types of mouse__

- Gaming mouse: They offers additional buttons. These buttons are sometimes programmable. This is useful in a game and can replace a combination of instructions useful for realtime games.  
- Ergonomic mouse: provides optimum comfort and avoids repetitive strain injuries.
- Wireless mouse: Connects to a computer via bluetooth or Wi-Fi, or using a receiver that plugs to the computer via USB. 
- Many more.

### Keyboard

Used to enter text commands. Most commonly used is the QWERTY layout (used in typewriters since 1873). Other layouts include QWERTZ (Germany/Switzerland) and AZERTY (France) and DVORAK (more ergonomic keyboard layout for English proposed by August Dvorak).

Variations include wired or wireless keyboards and numeric keypads. *Ergonomic* designs are recently becoming more popular.

### Input Devices: Others

- Gamepads or joysticks are used for playing games and running simulations.
- Digital / video cameras and webcams create images and videos.
- Biometric devices use features unique to an individual user (e.g. fingerprint).
- Touchscreens have a pressure-sensitive panel.
- Scanners digitize images or documents so they can be stored as files.
- Digital Tablets (sometimes called Digitizers) allow the user to create images or artwork using a stylus.
- Media card readers read/write data from/to different types of media cards (SD cards, video game cartridges, etc.)

## Output Devices

**Output Devices** are devices that *present* data and information *to* the user *from* a computer.

### Monitors

There are many different types of monitors use different technologies to create an image. However, the principles are the same:

* Digital representation of image to display is sent to the monitor
* The monitor produces each  __pixel__  (the smallest element of the screen or “atom” of monitor displays) using some deterministic physical technology
* Light from the monitor reaches us as a useful/pleasing image.

The following sections are the main technologies used today (from oldest to newest)

#### Cathode Ray Tube (CRT)

Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitors are very complicated, very cool, moderately dangerous, and mostly obsolete!

* The most common type of consumer and industry television before ~2010
* Basically: a **tungsten coil** is heated in a vacuum until it sheds electrons, those electrons are accelerated by an electric field and guided by magnets to hit a phosphor coated glass display to emit light in a pixel grid

* **Obsolete** since today their are lighter, simpler higher resolution technologies
* Still used today for some applications due to  __zero latency__ .

#### Plasma

Plasma monitors use tiny cells of ionised gas that light up when stimulated by electricity.

* Often used in home theatre applications due to accurate video representation.
* High levels of brightness, deep black levels and very wide colour range.
* Have shorter life span, susceptible to “screen burn-in” (this is why screensavers are called “screen savers”! Same for CRT).

**Pros**

- Plasma cell will produce light that looks good from every angle, it has high refresh rate (videos are smoother)

**Cons**

- BUT! Consumes a lot of electricity
- Doesn’t work at high altitudes! (due to the low pressure)

![Plasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge).
Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. 
Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma 
Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)](https://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.datocms-assets.com%2F117510%2F1722315244-plasma_display_panel.jpg%3Fw%3D1840%26h%3D1128.8888888888887&w=1920&q=85&dpl=dpl_3YP78pZRnY9CGfKJxe4qZAoXodaE)


#### Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)

An LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. *Liquid cystal* is a modelcule between liquid (not ordered and constant motion) and crystal (ordered fashion). This technology allows for precise control of color without the need to ionise gas with powerful electronics.

  - Commonly used in flat panel monitors and laptops.
  - Consists of a  __white__  backlight, two polarizing filters, and liquid crystal solution.
  - An electronic current aligns and controls the crystals so that light can pass through them.

  **Pros**

  - Allow the use of **flat** screens!

  **Cons**
  
  - Due to the backlight, black screens are never perfectly black! It always lets some light pass through.
  - Because of the polarizing filters, different viewing angles impact heavily the appearance of the image.
  - Somewhat inefficient due to the many layers reducing the brightness of the screen.

![The polarizing filter lets only one orientation of the light pass through.
An LCD Screen is made up of layers of very thin glass, liquid crystal, metal and dielectrics. The projector beam will emit white light which contains all wavelengths. Liquid crystal is a molecule between liquid and crytal state (ordered vs unordered) which has the characteristics of changing orientation under specific voltage. This allows for a precise control of the passage of light. 
To transform the white light into colored light, a color filter is placed on the outter face - made of pigments which will absorb all colors execept the color that is passing (red, blue or green). [This video provides a full explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx-JVoOFYhs&ab_channel=e-learning%C3%A9lectronique)](_assets/external-components-32.png){width=70% fig-align="center" fig-alt="alt text."}


#### Light emitting diode (LED)

  * An LCD display that uses LED backlighting instead of a white backlight to light the display. It still uses Liquid crystals (LCD technology). The brightness of each RGB LED is controlled programmatically to produce each pixel.

  **Pros**
  
  - __Thinner__  (no layers), lighter and brighter, and displays better contrast
  - __Lower power __ consumption.
  - Better representation of blacks (compared to original LCDs)
  - Improved color filters using quantum dots, which creates vibrant colors.
  - Have become the most affordable types of Monitors. 
  - LEDs backlight lasts for very long making them less susceptible to burn-in compared to OLED screens.

  **Cons**

  - Not yet a perfect representation of black!
  - The individual light diodes level of light is not controlled, it's still requires liquid crystals to modulate the light.
  - This means that polarized light is still used reducing the viewing angles compared to OLED screens.


![LED Grid used for backlighting of each individual pixel. 
- ](_assets/external-components-35.jpg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}



#### Organic LED (OLED)

OLED displays are similar to LED, but no backlighting required -- the organic material used to create these displays emits light when an electrical current is applied.

  * Similar to LED, but  __no backlighting__ required -- the material used to create these displays emits light when  __an electrical current is applied__ .

**Pros**

  - Allows for  __perfect representation of dark colors__ unlike all other monitor technologies. Also allows for flexible and transparent monitors

**Cons**

  - More expensive to produce
  - More susceptible to screen-burn-in than LCD or LED (but better than Plasma and CRT in this respect)

Here’s a great [video (8 mins)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyLDA9QT8EY) explaining both physical and software technologies required to make the above monitors work.

With LCD, LED, and OLED, we finally get to the most modern monitor technologies. These are used in our labs, most computers, laptops. They’re ordered here approximately in order of lowest (LCD) -> highest (OLED) quality, though pros and cons exist for each. 

See here for more information:  _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CRT,_LCD,_Plasma,_and_OLED_displays)_.

#### Metrics for choosing the right monitor
The first step is to define how the monitor will be used: personal vs. professional use, gaming, graphic design, content creation, etc.
You should look for a monitor that meets your needs based on a few common metrics:


- **Resolution**: Indicates how many pixels are used to display an image and how small they are. Higher-resolution monitors (e.g., 4K) offer sharper and more detailed images.


- **Refresh Rate**: Refers to how many times per second the display updates the image, measured in hertz (Hz), such as 60Hz. It is closely related to the frames per second (FPS) that the computer’s graphics card can output.


- **Color Accuracy**: Describes how accurately the display reproduces colors. There are various standards to measure color accuracy, but this can be a somewhat subjective criterion depending on the use case.


- **Brightness**: Measures the intensity of light emitted by the display, expressed in nits. Optimal brightness levels range from 100–300 nits for indoor use and 400–700 nits for outdoor use.


- **Contrast**: Indicates the difference in intensity between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks on the screen. It is typically expressed as a ratio (e.g., 1000:1). Good contrast enhances image sharpness, especially around edges and areas with opposing colors.

### Printers

Printers take data from a computer and generate output on paper: Basic principles

  * Similar to monitor (high quantity of small, well placed “pixels” → the visual quality of a coherent image)
  * Rather than orienting light photons on a screen, printers deposit liquid stains on to paper. The physical setup is different, but the same principles are at work.

![A high enough quantity of toasted bread produces the qualitative impression of a human eye in this “piece” of art. Printers (and monitors) use much higher quantities of “pixels” than depicted here!](_assets/external-components28.png)

#### Dot-matrix printers

  * Uses print heads containing pins which produce patterns of dots on the paper by mechanical impact (pressing).
  * Inexpensive and typically print at a speed of 100 - 600 characters per second.
  * (Optional) See  _[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer)_  for more detail on history and technology
  * While still in use for particular applications (printing receipts for e.g.), these are now obsoleted by ink-jet printers.

#### Ink-jet printers

![Ink-jet printer technology. This animation shows how droplets are pushed through the nozzle of the printing head](_assets/external-components-38.gif){widht="50%" fig-align="center"}

  - Uses tiny droplets of ink to produce images.
  - Heat is applied to an ink reservoir, which pushes ink bubbles through a nozzle in a controlled manner.
  - The ink liquid droplets are smaller in diameter than a human hair! Many of these added together produce the quality of a coherent image.
  - Quieter than dot-matrix, and also provide better speed and higher quality.

:::

#### Laser Printers
![Laser Printer. This animation shows how the ink powder sticks to the rotating drum. The drum contains a special coating to which allows the toner (ink powder) to stick. A laser beam then conveys information to the drum, neutralizing and detaching some toner. As the paper rolls by the drum, the toner is transferred onto the paper. A hot roller then bonds toner to the paper. ](_assets/external-components-40.gif){ width="80%" fig-aligh="center" fig-alt="Laser printer mechanism."}

* Expensive when they were initially introduced.
* Produce high-quality output quietly at a high speed.
* Produces images by directing a laser beam at a mirror which bounces the beam onto a drum.

### Other output devices
- Projectors
- Speakers
- Headphones



## Connectors

**Connectors** are how to get the computer to talk to all these output devices!

### Cables

Some technical terms:

- __Cable (electric)__ : The insulated copper wire that carries electrical/digital signals from devices to/from computers
- __Cable (optical)__ : The insulated glass tube that carries digital signals in the form of *light* between devices and computers
- __Port__ : The slot where the insertable end of USB cable is connected to the computer
- __“Male” / “Female” cable ends__ : Distinguishing between the insertable end and the receptacle end for cables
- __Converter__ : A device that allows different standards/types of connectors to be used together

#### Electrical cables

Transmits an electrical signal on a conducting wire, insulated to protect the signal/surroundings

![](_assets/external-components34.png)

#### Optical cables

Transmits a signal in the form of light. Very fast! (speed of light in glass). 

![](_assets/external-components33.png)

A short paper (5 pages) comparing the two cable technologies in more detail: _[Fibre Optics vs Copper Cabling: Understanding the Differences](https://optronicsplus.net/downloads/whitepapers/OP_Fibre_Optics_vs_Copper_Cabling_Understanding_the_Difference_White_Paper_Rev.1.0.pdf)_

### Analog versus Digital signal cables
* **Analog** cables carry a continuous and fluctuating electrical signal representing the original penomena (example sound waves). 
* **Digital** cables transmit a binary discrete (sequence of 1 or 0)

### USB

- **Universal Serial Bus** is used to connect most modern devices to computers. 
- Back in the day, mice/keyboards/external storage, speakers, etc., all had different cables. These have now been mostly unified under the USB standard.

- USB connectors can transmit both **power** (e.g. charging phones) and **information** (data). Despite being "Universal" there are an incredible number of USB types.

![Different types of USB connectors](_assets/external-components-usb.jpg){width=70%}

---
#### USB Standards

**USB “Number”** Standards determines the transmission speed & power


- 🐢 USB 2 (slower, less power)
- 🏎️ USB 3 (faster, more power)
- 🚀 USB 4 (super fast, high power)


**USB “Letter” Standards**  refer to the physical design of the connector and the port

- e.g. USB C and USB A are incompatible interfaces, cannot be interchanged.


![Different types of USB standards.](_assets/external-components36.png)

![Newer standards are  __backwards compatible__  (e.g. USB 3.1 cable works in USB 1.1 port at USB 1.1 speed/power)](_assets/external-components37.png)


### Audio

A headphone jack is a port into which you plug your headphones. Sometimes called AUX, audio jack or phone jack. The plug, on the other hand,is the part at the end of your headphones' cable that is inserted into the jack.
Most commonly the standard headphone jack (TSR connector). Available in several sizes, most commonly 3.5mm or ⅛” mini audio jack. Can be color coded - microphone (pink), speaker (green).

![Headphone Jack vs Plug](_assets/external-components-audio.png)

![Various sizes of TSR connector (headphone jack)](_assets/external-components38.png)
:::

For higher-end audio, we can use fiberoptic cables as these can transmit larger amounts of data more quickly, which is required for producing a high-quality audio signal.

### Video
![Different types of video cables](_assets/external-components-video.png){width=80% fig-align="center" }

**VGA** cable is analog signal cable used for computer monitors. It had 15 pins arranged in 3 rows. It's a low resolution cable and now obsolete. There exist converter cables to connect VGA monitors to newer computers. 

**MiniVGA** is a variant found on laptops.

**DVI** cabe is analog/digital upgrade from VGA, capable of higher resolutions. It isn't used as much today. MiniDVI and MicroDVI on “thin” laptops.

**S-Video** commonly used for DVD players, camcorders and older consoles.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![VGA, DVI, and RCA cables](_assets/external-components42.png)

![DVI. Can be distinguished from VGA by noticing that it is a much wider interface with many more pins.](_assets/external-components43.png)

![S-video](_assets/external-components44.png)

![A converter from mini-DP to three possible outputs: DP, DVI, and HDMI](_assets/external-components41.png)


:::


**RCA cables** include composite video (yellow) and stereo audio cables (red for right; white/black for left). It's mainly an analog cable. Component video offers a better picture.
> RCA stands for **R**adio **C**orporation **A**merica. 

**HDMI** is the new standard for audio and video transmission in a single cable. It transmits digital signal only. It allows for a single cable to carry both audio and video simplifying connections and improving signal quality.

**DisplayPort** (and Mini DisplayPort) more commonly used in desktop computers. It transmits digital signal only. It support the transmission of audio, video, and other additional data, as well as multi-channel audio, and support multi monitor configurations. It is  widely used in professional applications and high-performance computing.

### Data

eSATA (External Serial Advanced Technology Attachement) is used internally to connect the hard drive to the motherboard but can also be used for portable hard drives. They provide a high-speed interface for transferring data between the external storage device and the host system. We will see them in the upcoming labs.

> The current trend has seen a decline in the use of eSATA by USB type C. 

![](_assets/external-components49.png)


### Networking

Telephone cable (RJ11) used for connecting to the internet through DSL/ADSL modems. Standard phone cable has 4 wires; connector has 4 pins. Clip helps to maintain tight connection.

Ethernet (RJ45) is the standard for wired networking. Based on Cat5 twisted pair cable, made from 8 individual wires. Connector looks similar to phone plug but is thicker and wider. Also uses a clip to maintain tight connection.
