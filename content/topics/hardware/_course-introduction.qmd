## Rules for success in this class

### Rule 1: Attend all classes and labs!

I will freely provide my slides and as many course resources as necessary to supplement this class.

But! My course notes are not a substitute for regular class attendance. Hands on experience is key!

### Rule 2: Consult the Support Material

* Class Slides
* Lab and exercises in class
* Assignments
* Your class notes

### Rule 3: Use a calendar to track all your deadlines

* To stay on track for all your deadlines\, try to plan one or two weeks ahead\!
* Complete your assignments on time
  * But\! Endeavour to at least hand in assignments\. Better late/incomplete than never\.
* If you miss a deadline\, please don't ignore it\!
  * MIO me\. Iâ€™m here to help\! And that includes for late/incomplete assignments\.

### Rule 4: Reach out for help!

* Reach out to me if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed
* Try your best to get to know other students
  * Help each other out! You will learn much more from working through the assignments yourself and from teaching eachother than you will from listening to me
  * Learning from others and building relationships with new peers is one of the most valuable parts of school
* Seek out help if you are struggling \(from me\, from peers\, from John Abbott student services\, etc\.\)

### Rule 5: Be curious!

This field has a lot of support online. Stay curious\, the internet is your Oyster\!
