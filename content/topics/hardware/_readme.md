# Technical Support: Teacher Prep
# Week 1

## Objectives

- Introduce the course to the students
- Introduce computer and external devices 
- Work on a lab involving researching a peripheral device. 

## Peripheral devices 

- Bring a few examples of peripheral devices (e.g. mouse, keyboard)

- Why mechanical ball mouse went obsolete? 
- - Unreliable, 
- - Gets dirty 
- - doesn't work easily on all surfaces.

### Monitors

- We do not expect students to understand the physics of how displays work, but they should understand some of the differences related to image quality, durability and price. Most importantly, they should know how to plug-in a monitor and which cables to use. 

#### Plasma

- Plasma is a chemical state of molecules when molecules in state of gas are heated up (excited with electric charge).

- Typical Plasma displays have two glass plates sandwiching hundreds of thousands of cells containing plasma. 

- Two sets of electrodes will provide some charges which will excite the plasma 

- Which will release photons at three different wavelength (either red, green or blue)
- They are expensive and power hungry! 
- They don't work at high altitude due to the low pressure affecting the plasma's excitation mechanism. 



#### LED

 A good way to introduce the idea of backlight pixels is using gift paper: Red, Green and Blue stick side by side on a square frame, explaining that this is a very large representation of a pixel. Then shining a light at the back using a cell phone flashlight. This is a much more memorable way of remembering the concept and is coming from Mike Meyers's Comptia A+ training videos. 

What's TN, IPS LCD monitors? 

- Much of this variation, affect image quality or price.

**Resolution**

There are a lot of different resolutions, student should understand what different resolutions means, and how to compare different monitors. 

**Brightness**

The unit of measurement of light, is **nit** A good LCD panel is 200-500 nits for indoor use, and 500-1000+ nits for outdoor. 

**Latency**

Response time is important for a smooth image and is measured in milliseconds. The shorter the latency the better the monitor. 



### OLED

- Very thin technology
- Uses the same idea as LED monitors 



### DLP

- Uses a grid of mirrors
- One light source that goes through a colour wheel and hitting this matrix of mirrors which will give a wide range of colours. 

# Internal components

## Case
- What is static electricity?
Electric charge imbalance between various objects which causes a transfer of electrons which could cause damage to electronic components.
- How is the case protecting from that?
It grounds the components by being made of conductive material (usually metal) and being connected to the ground pin of the power supply. This ensures that any static charge is safely discharged to the ground instead of going through the components.
