### Case

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components2.png)

* Provides protection and cooling for the internal components\.
* Also prevents damage from  static electricity  \(components grounded via attachment to case\)\.
* Usually made of plastic\, steel or aluminum\.
* Fans move air through the case:
  * to replace warm air with cold air to keep components at stable temperatures
  * to prevent build\-up of dust
  * There exist many guides/studies for optimal airflow\. E\.g\.  _[https://voltcave\.com/pc\-airflow\-guide/](https://voltcave.com/pc-airflow-guide/)_

### Power Supply

__Main purpose: __ Converts AC power \(alternating current\) from wall socket to DC power \(direct current\)\. Direct current \(0 or 5V\) is used to power digital circuits\.

Note: PSU have their own fans. Energy conversion releases a lot of heat!

### Activity: Feeling Your Way

With a partner\, take it in turns to close your eyes and feel around the back of a PC\.

Try and identify the connectors  you find\. Your partner can help you by confirming your guesses\.

### Power Supply

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components8.png)

* Computers can only tolerate slight fluctuations in power without  __needing to shut down__
  * \.
* Important:  <span style="color:#FF0000"> __Never open a power supply\!__ </span>  The capacitors contained within can keep a dangerous high voltage\, high power charge long after being unplugged\.

<span style="color:#FF0000">Demo: PSU What are the supported DV outputs?</span>

#### Uninterruptible Power Supply

In the case of a power outage\, an Uninterruptible Power Supply \(UPS\) can keep a computer running for a few minutes to several hours depending on the sophistication of the UPS\. See  <span style="color:#0563C1"> _[https://www\.wikihow\.com/Buy\-and\-Use\-an\-Uninterruptible\-Power\-Supply](https://www.wikihow.com/Buy-and-Use-an-Uninterruptible-Power-Supply)_ </span>  for an example

We will talk more about uninterruptible power supply when we start speaking about server hardware\.

#### Power Supply Connectors

* Most power supply connectors are : 20 \+ 4 pins
* Usually made up of wires of various colors:
  * Yellow 12V
  * Red 5V
  * Orange 3\.3V
  * Other colors may be ground 0V

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components9.png)

#### Power Supply Ratings

* <span style="color:#FF0000"> __Useful for Assignment 1__ </span>
* Ratings:
  * Wattage \(amount of power delivered\, must be greater than the sum of power required by all parts\, some power supplies can provide more power than others\)
  * Efficiency \(Law of thermodynamics: 100% power input cannot be converted to 100% power output; some power supplies have higher efficiency ratings than others\)
  * For more detailed explanation:  <span style="color:#0563C1"> _[https://www\.newegg\.com/insider/how\-to\-choose\-a\-pc\-power\-supply\-buying\-guide/](https://www.newegg.com/insider/how-to-choose-a-pc-power-supply-buying-guide/)_ </span>

### Connectors

These connect specific components to various ports on the motherboard\.

Most connectors are  __keyed__  \(can only be inserted one way\)\.

Note: Always check the pins if you have trouble with a connector\. “If it doesn’t go in like butter\, it doesn’t go in at all” \-\- never force a connection\! you are likely going to damage the pins\.

# Types of connectors

Floppy drive connectors \(old days\)

SATA Cables \(for hard drives\)

Molex – Less used but still present

# 4) Motherboard (overview)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components16.png)

Connects the CPU\, RAM\, Expansion ports\.

Composed of various chips all combined into  __north __ and  __south__  bridges

More on those in a few weeks\.\.\.

# 4) Motherboard - Form Factors

Main circuit board and controls the electrical pathways \( <span style="color:#0055A4">buses</span> \) found in a computer\.

The buses allow data to travel between the various components of a computer\.

Various form factors\, e\.g\. AT\, ATX\, LPX\, BTX\, ITX\.

2001

<span style="color:#000000">9\.6" x 9\.6"</span>

IBM 1980s

Huge 12 x 13"\, no ports

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components17.png)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components18.png)

---

ITX – used for imbedded systems such as routers

You'll notice that the I/O Ports on the mother board is always located around the same area\.

This is to keep certain consistency across manufacturer and regardless of the form factors

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components19.png)

* __AT __
  * Invented by IBM in early 1980s\, now obsolete\.
  * Huge in size \(approximately 12 x 13 inches\)\.
  * Needed lots of space for power supply and its various chips\.
  * Lacked external ports\, only allowed for monitor and keyboard\.
* __ATX__
  * Created in 1995 to meet the need for more connectors\.
  * Got off to a slow start but by 1998 became the most common form factor\.
  * Biggest change to AT was the rear panel with standard set of ports for expansion\.
  * Power supply position for better airflow\, CPU and RAM positioned for easier access\.
  * Variations 12x9in \(full size\)\, 9\.6x9\.6in \(microATX\)\, 9x7\.5in \(FlexATX no longer used\)\.

Extra slide for studying

* __ITX__
  * Created in 2001 to meet the demand for smaller computers\.
  * ITX failed but led to development of  smaller form factor \(SSF\) motherboards\.
  * MiniITX \(6\.7x6\.7in\)\, NanoITX \(4\.7x4\.7in\) and PicoITX \(3\.8x2\.8in\)
  * Commonly used for embedded systems and specialized devices such as routers\.
  * Require very little power\, therefore produce less heat\.
* __Proprietary__
  * Some computer manufacturers make motherboards that work only with their cases\.
  * Services and upgrades usually need to be handled by authorized dealers\.
  * Often hard to get replacement parts and they are usually expensive\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components21.png)

# 5) CPU

* Most important element of the computer in terms of computing power\.
  * Brains of the computer\.
  * Responsible for  __interpreting __ and  __executing __ the commands from the software\.
  * While the CPU is processing one step of the program\, the remaining instructions and the data are stored in a special memory called cache\.

# How to Connect a CPU?

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">CPU connection on the motherboard is known as the CPU socket\.</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">The CPU is connected to the motherboard in one of two ways:</span>

* Pin Grid Array – PGA
  * Pins are on the CPU \(underside of the processor\)\.
  * Socket on motherboard includes holes that line up with the CPU pins\.

* Land Grid Array – LGA
  * Pins are on the motherboard \(on socket\) instead of on the processor\.

# CPU Core Components

“Man\-in\-a\-box”

Clever guy who can perform any mathematical function quickly\.

He lives in a closed\-up box so it is hard to communicate with him\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components29.png)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components30.png)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components31.png)

# CPU Analogy: “Man in a Box”

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components32.png)

* Imagine we install a set of 16 lightbulbs
  * \(8 inside\, 8 outside\)\.
* These can be controlled by us and by the man\-in\-the\-box\.This is our external data bus \(EDB\)\.
* We can communicate with each other as long as we agree ahead of time what each pattern of light bulbs means\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components33.png)

# Codebook

<span style="color:#0055A4"> __Codebook__ </span>

This defines the commands that we can give to the man in the box\.

If we both have a copy\, then we can give him commands and he can understand them\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components34.png)

# Registers

<span style="color:#0055A4"> __Registers__ </span>

We can give the man some work and see what he replies\.

But to do his work\, the man needs at least four workstations\.

General purpose registers are the most common\. AX\, BX\, CX\, DX \(Intel\)\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components35.png)

# Clock

Now we are ready to put our man to work\.We can send him the first command by lighting up the wires on the EDB\.

But how does he know when we have finished setting up the light bulbs?

# 6.1) Cooling Devices - Fans

The flow of current between the electronic components generates heat\.  <span style="color:#FF0000">The man in the box is heating\!\!</span>

<span style="color:#0055A4">Fans</span>  inside the case increase airflow and removes heat\.

Occasionally video cards or other components have their own fans to cool them\.

# Activity: Cooling devices Fans vs Liquid cooling

With a partner take 5\-7 minutes to research the major differences between Fans and liquid cooling devices\.

# 6.2) Cooling Devices – Heat sinks

* <span style="color:#0055A4">Heat sinks </span> also draw heat away from the CPU core\.
  * A heat sink is a piece of copper or aluminum that resides between the processor and the CPU fan\.
  * It absorbs the heat from the processor and the fan disperses the heat\.
  * Increase of the surface area

# 4.2) Motherboard – RAM slots

Let’s have a closer look at the RAM slots

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components40.png)

# 5) Main Memory

* Referred to as RAM \(Random Access Memory\)
* RAM is a collection of integrated circuits \(chips\)\.
* Considered the “Primary” storage for the CPU\.
  * <span style="color:#0055A4">Temporary</span>  storage for  <span style="color:#0055A4">data</span>  and  <span style="color:#0055A4">programs</span>  that are being accessed by the CPU\.
* Volatile memory: contents are erased when the computer is switched off\. \(or when power is lost\)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components41.png)

# 5) Main Memory (cont.)

More RAM means more capacity to hold and process large programs and files\.

Maximum installed is limited by the  <span style="color:#FF0000">motherboard </span> and the  <span style="color:#FF0000">operating system\.</span>

# 4.1) Motherboard – Expansion Slots

Let’s have a closer look at what we call expansion slots\.

Expansion slots are ports inside a computer found on the motherboard\. They provide the possibility to expand the hardware of your PC\.

For example\, you may want to install a network card\, a sound card\, and most importantly a video card\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components42.png)

# 5) Expansion Slots

<span style="color:#0055A4">Expansion slots </span> allow us to increase the functionality of a computer by adding controllers for specific devices \(often called  <span style="color:#0055A4">adapter cards</span> \) e\.g\. sound\, video\, NIC \(network Interface Card\)\.

PCI 		used in most computers\, 32 or 64 bit

AGP 		designed to be used by video adapters

PCIe		replacing AGP in newer computers

ISA		older\, rarely used\, 8 or 16 bit

EISA		older\, rarely used\, 32 bit

MCA		IBM proprietary 32 bit\, older\, rarely used

PCI\-X		32 bit\, can run up to four times faster than PCI

MiniPCI	32 bit\, used by laptops\, has three different form factors

# 7) Graphics Cards

Also known as Video cards or Graphical Processing Units

One of the most interesting use of expansion slots is the addition of video cards\, also known as Graphical Processing Unit\.

Its speeds up the processing power of a computer\.

Often useful in video gaming\, video rendering\, scientific parallel computing

# GPU VS CPU

# CPU vs GPU

GPU cannot replace the CPU because their architecture is different and meant for different purposes

GPU is great to parallelize computations\!

But the GPU is not as versatile as the CPU which has a larger instruction set \(code book\)

# 8) Storage Devices

Storage devices store data  <span style="color:#0055A4">permanently</span> \.

Some are installed inside the case \(e\.g\. hard drive\);

Some are removable and portable \(e\.g\. external flash drive\)\.

# 7.1) Storage Devices: Floppy Drive

Uses 3\.5 inch floppy disks \(or 5\.25 inch floppy disks \- older\)\.

Largely obsolete\.

Magnetic disks store up to 1\.44Meg of data\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components63.png)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components64.png)

# 7.2) Storage Devices: Hard Drive

* Hard Disk Drive \(HDD\)
  * Traditional hard drives\.
  * Uses magnetic\-based storage on a moving disk \(somewhat like a vinyl player\)
  * Magnetic hard drives have drive motors that spin the magnetic platters and move the drive heads\.
  * Speed measured in revolutions per minute

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components65.jpg)

<span style="color:#FF0000">Demo: how does it look inside an HDD</span>

* Solid State Drives \(SSD\)
  * Do not have moving parts and use __ semi\-conductors__  to store data\.
  * Non\-volatile flash memory chips manage the storage on an SSD\, resulting in faster access to data\, higher reliability and reduced power usage\.
* Usually configured as C: drive on a Windows machine and contains the operating system and applications\. Storage capacity can range from gigabytes to terabytes\.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20-%20System%20Unit%20Components66.png)

# 7.4) Storage Devices: Tape Drive

Magnetic tapes are often used for backups or archiving data\. Still used/created to this day\! Very cheap per GB costs\.

Data retrieval can be fast but locating specific data is slow\.

Can hold many terabytes\.

# 7.5) Storage Devices: Optical Drive

* Uses lasers to read the data on the optical media\.
  * CD \(compact disc\) 700 Mb
  * DVD \(digital versatile disc\) 4\-8 Gb\.
  * BD \(Blu\-ray disc\) 25\-50 Gb\.
* Optical media can be:
  * Pre\-recorded \(read only\)
  * Recordable \(write once\)
  * Re\-recordable \(read and write multiple times\)\.

# Storage Devices: Interfaces

To install a drive internally in a computer\, the connection interface on the drive must be the same as the controller on the motherboard\.

Motherboards support different types of interfaces\.

# Storage Devices: Interfaces Types (In order of oldest to newest)

| IDE <br />  | Integrated Drive Electronics / Advanced Technology Attachment.<br />Also called ATA.<br />Early drive controller interface, originally only supported hard drives up to 540 MB.<br />Uses a 40 pin connector, and maximum cable length of 46cm (18in). |
| :-: | :-: |
| EIDE | Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (also called ATA-2).<br />Updated version of IDE, supporting larger drives and direct memory access.<br />Uses a 40 pin connector. |
| PATA | Parallel version of ATA.<br />Used internally due to maximum cable length of 46cm (18in).<br />Largely replaced by SATA in newer systems. |
| SATA (most commonly used today) | Serial version of ATA, with slimmer and longer cables providing better airflow.<br />Uses 7-pin connector (less pins means less issues with electromagnetic interference).<br />SATA hard drives tend to be quieter than IDE drives. |

# Storage Devices: Interfaces Types (cont.)

| eSATA  | External serial ATA, provides a hot-swappable external interface for SATA. |
| :-: | :-: |
| SCSI | Small Computer System Interface.<br />Drive controller that can connect up to 15 drives.<br />Internal and external use, uses 25, 50 or 68 pin connector. |

_Note:_  __ Hot\-swapping is the ability to connect and disconnect a device while the computer is on\.__

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Source: https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Memory\_hierarchy </span>

# Build PC: How do I choose a motherboard?

Identify the user need for this PC: let's say Gamer PC

2\.  Go to PC [Parts Picker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/)

3\.  Select a CPU \(that matches your needs\) and ask yourself those questions

4\. What would be the most appropriate form factor?

5\. What's the max RAM needed?

6\. Would you need expansion ports in the future?

7\. What's the aesthetic feel of the PC? LEDs? Metal built?

This will restrict the types of motherboards you can use\.
