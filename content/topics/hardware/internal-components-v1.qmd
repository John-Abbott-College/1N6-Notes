# Important things to know about components

* When discussing components of any complicated machine, we should try to understand the following about those components:
* __Make/model__ :
  * The brand and product name of the component.
    * E.g.  __Hyundai__   __Accent__  (make = Hyundai, model = Accent)
  * Why it’s important: Who constructs these components? Are their multiple different versions of this component made by the same manufacturer? Why?
* __Properties:__
  * The  __quantitative__  (numeric) and  __qualitative __ (non-numeric) traits of the component that can be compared with alike components
    * Quantitative e.g.: the Fuel Efficiency of the 2009 Hyundai Accent is  __29 MPG __ (miles per gallon)
    * Qualitative e.g: The Hyundai Accent is a hatchback, not a sedan
  * Why it’s important:
    * what is the expected performance of this component?
    * Is their a cost/benefit for choosing a component with better suited properties than other components?
    * Etc.
* These two ideas (make/model, properties) will vary significantly from component to component. You will need to know these ideas for all of the components we discuss today.

# Internal Components: Case

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%292.png)

* Provides protection and cooling for the internal components.
* Also prevents damage from static electricity (components grounded via attachment to case).
* Usually made of plastic, steel or aluminum.
* Fans move air through the case:
  * to replace warm air with cold air to keep components at stable temperatures
  * to prevent build-up of dust
  * There exist many guides/studies for optimal airflow. E.g.  _[https://voltcave.com/pc-airflow-guide/](https://voltcave.com/pc-airflow-guide/)_

Note: PSU have their own fans:

Energy conversion releases a lot of heat!

# Uninterruptible Power Supply

In the case of a power outage, an  __Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)__  can keep a computer running for a few minutes to several hours depending on the sophistication of the UPS. See  _[https://www.wikihow.com/Buy-and-Use-an-Uninterruptible-Power-Supply](https://www.wikihow.com/Buy-and-Use-an-Uninterruptible-Power-Supply)_  for an example.

It’s basically a large battery that keeps charge during normal operation, and powers a computer using its stored charge when the building’s power is cut off.

We will talk more about uninterruptible power supply when we start speaking about server hardware.

# Power Supply

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%296.png)

* Computers can only tolerate slight fluctuations in power without  __needing to shut down__
  * .
* Important:  __Never open a power supply!__  The capacitors contained within can keep a dangerous high voltage, high power charge long after being unplugged.

Demo: PSU What are the supported DV outputs?


---


# Power Supply Connectors

* Most power supply connectors are : 20 + 4 pins
* Usually made up of wires of various colors:
  * Yellow 12V
  * Red 5V
  * Orange 3.3V
  * Other colors may be ground 0V

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%297.png)


---


# Power Supply Ratings

* __Useful for Assignment 1__
* Ratings:
  * __Wattage__  (amount of power delivered, must be greater than the sum of power required by all parts, some power supplies can provide more power than others)
  * __Efficiency__  (1st + 2nd Laws of thermodynamics: 100% power input cannot be converted to 100% power output; some power supplies have higher efficiency ratings than others)
  * For more detailed explanation:  _[https://www.newegg.com/insider/how-to-choose-a-pc-power-supply-buying-guide/](https://www.newegg.com/insider/how-to-choose-a-pc-power-supply-buying-guide/)_

# Motherboard (overview)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%298.png)

Connects the CPU, RAM, Expansion ports.

Composed of various chips all combined into  __north __ and  __south__  bridges

More on those in a few weeks...

Main circuit board and controls the electrical pathways (buses) found in a computer.

The buses allow data to travel between the various components of a computer.

Various form factors, e.g. AT, ATX, LPX, BTX, ITX.

# Internal Components: Motherboard – Form Factors (I)

* AT __ __
  * Invented by IBM in early 1980s, now obsolete.
  * Huge in size (approximately 12 x 13 inches).
  * Needed lots of space for power supply and its various chips.
  * Lacked external ports, only allowed for monitor and keyboard.
* __ATX__
  * Created in 1995 to meet the need for more connectors.
  * Got off to a slow start but by 1998 became the most common form factor.
  * Biggest change to AT was the rear panel with standard set of ports for expansion.
  * Power supply position for better airflow, CPU and RAM positioned for easier access.
  * Variations 12x9in (full size), 9.6x9.6in ( __microATX__ )
* __ATX and microATX are the most common in personal desktop computers today__


---


* __ITX__
  * Created in 2001 to meet the demand for smaller computers.
  * ITX failed but led to development of  smaller form factor (SSF) motherboards.
  * MiniITX (6.7x6.7in), NanoITX (4.7x4.7in) and PicoITX (3.8x2.8in)
  * Commonly used for embedded systems and specialized devices such as routers.
  * Require very little power, therefore produce less heat.
* __Proprietary__
  * Some computer manufacturers make motherboards that work only with their cases.
  * Services and upgrades usually need to be handled by authorized dealers.
  * Often hard to get replacement parts and they are usually expensive.


---


# Motherboard - Ports

You'll notice that the I/O Ports (input/output) on the mother board are always located around the same area.

This is to keep certain consistency across manufacturer and regardless of the form factors

# Internal Components: Connectors

* There are a variety of connectors used to connect components to the motherboard. Two main purposes:
  * __Signals__ : for communication/data transfer
  * __Power__ : not all components connect directly to the power supply, they get power from the motherboard
* Most connectors are  __keyed__  (can only be inserted one way).
* Note: Always check the pins if you have trouble with a connector.
  * “If it doesn’t go in like butter, it doesn’t go in at all” -- never force a connection! you are likely going to damage the pins.

# Motherboard – Expansion Slots

Let’s have a closer look at what we call expansion slots.

Expansion slots are ports inside a computer found on the motherboard. They provide the possibility to expand the hardware of your PC.

For example, you may want to install a network card, a sound card, and most commonly, a video card.

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%2917.png)

Expansion slots allow us to increase the functionality of a computer by adding controllers for specific devices (often called adapter cards) e.g. sound, video, NIC (network Interface Card).

__PCI 		used in most computers, commonly used for network interface__

AGP 		designed to be used by video adapters

__PCIe		replaces AGP in newer computers, used for video cards__

ISA		older, rarely used, 8 or 16 bit

EISA		older, rarely used, 32 bit

MCA		IBM proprietary 32 bit, older, rarely used

PCI-X		32 bit, can run up to four times faster than PCI

MiniPCI	32 bit, used by laptops, has three different form factors

In 2024 __: PCI __ and  __PCIe __ are the common standards that cover all features required for  __expansion slots__

# How to Connect a CPU?

CPU connection on the motherboard is known as the CPU socket.

The CPU is connected to the motherboard in one of two ways:

* Pin Grid Array – PGA
  * Pins are on the CPU (underside of the processor).
  * Socket on motherboard includes holes that line up with the CPU pins.

* Land Grid Array – LGA
  * Pins are on the motherboard (on socket) instead of on the processor.

# CPU

* Most important element of the computer in terms of computing power.
  * Brains of the computer.
  * Responsible for  __interpreting __ and  __executing __ the commands from the software.
  * While the CPU is processing one step of the program, the remaining instructions and the data are stored in a special memory called cache.

# Cooling Devices

* The flow of current between and within electronic components generates heat. Some devices are particularly powerful heat-generators, due to the large current they draw:
  * CPUs typically come with their own cooling device
  * Cooling devices are built into GPUs and Power Supplies
* Fans inside the case increase airflow and removes heat.
* Heat sinks also draw heat away from the CPU core.
  * A heat sink is a piece of copper or aluminum that resides between the processor and the CPU fan.
  * It absorbs the heat from the processor and the fan disperses the heat.

# Cooling Devices - Fans

The flow of current between the electronic components generates heat.

Fans inside the case increase airflow and removes heat.

Occasionally video cards or other components have their own fans to cool them.

# Memory - RAM

Let’s have a closer look at the RAM slots on the motherboard

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%2933.png)


---


# Main Memory

Referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory)

RAM is a collection of integrated circuits (chips)

Temporary storage for data and programs that are being accessed by the CPU.

__Volatile memory__ : contents are erased when the computer is switched off. (or when power is lost)

![](_assets/Lecture%203%20Hardware%20Introduction%20%28Internal%20Components%2934.png)


---


# Main Memory (cont.)

* There are four main properties of RAM to know:
* __Capacity: __ Total memory (in GB, GigaBytes)
  * More RAM means more capacity to hold and process large programs and files.
  * Maximum installed is limited by the motherboard and the operating system.
* __Speed: __ How many operations per second
  * Many, millions or billions per second
  * 1MHz = 1 million / second, 1 GHz = 1 billion / second
* __Latency__ : How much time delay between communications
* __Generation:__  See next slides


---


# Memory Modules Design Types

* SIMMs (Single In-Line Memory Modules)
  * Have a single line of connectors.
  * Now obsolete.
* DIMMs (Dual In-Line Memory Modules)
  * Have two lines of connectors.
  * Have Wider bus (supports 64 bits) 🡪 How can this help? More on this in the coming weeks.
  * Became dominant (no need to state that a memory module is a DIMM).

# Memory Modules Generations(oldest to newest, approximately)

| Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) | DRAM that operates in time with the memory bus.<br />Tied to the system clock like the CPU and the memory controller.<br />Results in very little wasted time. |
| :-: | :-: |
| Double Data Rate SDRAM (DDR) | DDR transfers data twice as fast as SDRAM.Larger buffer gives it a huge boost. |
| Double Data Rate 2 SDRAM (DDR2) | DDR2 decreases noise making it faster than DDR. |
| Double Data Rate 3 SDRAM (DDR3) | DDR3 doubles the clock rate of DDR2, consumes less power and generates less heat. |
| Double Data Rate 4 SDRAM (DDR4) | DDR4 arrived in 2014 with even faster speeds. (most common RAM type in desktops/laptops today) |
| Double Data Rate 5 SDRAM (DDR5) | Introduced in 2020, is starting to become more widely adopted. |

__NOTE: Motherboards are usually compatible with only ONE generation of RAM. If you have a motherboard designed for DDR3, it cannot use DDR4 or DDR5.__

# Graphics Cards (GPU)

Also known as Video cards or Graphical Processing Units

One of the most interesting use of expansion slots is the addition of video cards, also known as Graphical Processing Unit.

A specialized version of a CPU designed for  __graphical__  processing (producing complex output to display on a monitor)

The computation needed for graphical processing is generally useful for scientific computing as well (lots of data in parallel)

# GPU & CPU, things in common

* __Both consume a lot of power and generate a lot of heat__
* __More powerful CPUs/GPUs require more powerful power supplies__
  * __TDP:__  __ Thermal Design Power, measures the number of Watts needed to power the device__
* __Both have performance measured in __  __speed__  __ (operations/second) like RAM__

# CPU vs GPU

GPU cannot replace the CPU because their architecture is different and meant for different purposes

GPU is great to parallelize computations!

But the GPU is not as versatile as the CPU which has a larger instruction set

# Storage Devices: Interfaces

To install a drive internally in a computer, the connection interface on the drive must be the same as the controller on the motherboard.

Motherboards support different types of interfaces.


---


# Storage Devices: Interfaces Types (In order of oldest to newest)

| IDE <br />  | Integrated Drive Electronics / Advanced Technology Attachment.<br />Also called ATA.<br />Early drive controller interface, originally only supported hard drives up to 540 MB.<br />Uses a 40 pin connector, and maximum cable length of 46cm (18in). |
| :-: | :-: |
| EIDE | Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (also called ATA-2).<br />Updated version of IDE, supporting larger drives and direct memory access.<br />Uses a 40 pin connector. |
| PATA | Parallel version of ATA.<br />Used internally due to maximum cable length of 46cm (18in).<br />Largely replaced by SATA in newer systems. |
| SATA (most commonly used today) | Serial version of ATA, with slimmer and longer cables providing better airflow.<br />Uses 7-pin connector (less pins means less issues with electromagnetic interference).<br />SATA hard drives tend to be quieter than IDE drives. |


---


# Storage Devices: Interfaces Types (cont.)

| eSATA  | External serial ATA, provides a hot-swappable external interface for SATA. |
| :-: | :-: |
| SCSI | Small Computer System Interface.<br />Drive controller that can connect up to 15 drives.<br />Internal and external use, uses 25, 50 or 68 pin connector.<br /><br /><br /> |

_Note:_  __ Hot-swapping is the ability to connect and disconnect a device while the computer is on.__
