## Introduction

We all interact with computers on a daily basis, whether we are aware or not. In
fact, it can be said that computers, or computing devices, have been part of
human society (in some manner or another) for _centuries_ -- even though the
computers we typically think of today are relatively recent inventions from the
20th century.

What is a computer? What is it that computers actually _do_? This lecture is a
brief introduction to these questions. The big picture definitions we learn here
will be helpful anchors for better understanding the more complicated and
detailed components of modern computers that we will need to learn to understand
technical support as a science and a profession.

## Lesson overview

- Understand what a computer is
- Compare and contrast different types of computers by complexity and
  capabilities
- Understand what modern digital computers are
- Understand the difference between personal computing devices and servers

## What is a computer?

A **computer** is an device designed to:

1. **store information**
2. **change that information** through human or automated interactions

A **computer** almost always features: (1) a mechanism for keeping information
intact and (2) interactive components to facilitate the modification of that
information.

## Is this a computer? Examples

The above definition sounds pretty general -- and it is! What kinds of things
count as computers, or follow the above two properties? Click through the tabs
below to see some examples, and a discussion for each on its ability to
_compute_ things.

## Desktops

Desktop computers, often referred to as the **Personal Computer (PC)**, are a
classic example of a modern computing device -- these are the computers that we
will be using in our labs, and upon which we will focus the majority of our
study this semester.

Desktop computers meet the computer definition above in many ways, but simply:
(1) information is stored in **disks**, and (2) information is modified by human
interaction using devices like **keyboards** and **mice**, and then modified by
the computer using a **central processing unit (CPU)**.

![A **desktop computer** is composed of **external (peripheral) components** like monitors, keyboards, and mice for human interaction (input/output), as well as **internal (system) components** that are usually stored inside of a case or tower like in the image above, to keep sensitive electrical components safe.

We will learn in future lectures the deep gritty detail of how devices like
disks, keyboards, mice, CPUs, and others make modern computer magic happen.

## Laptops

**Laptop computers** meet the computer definition above in the exact same way as
desktop computers: (1) information is stored in **disks** (usually smaller in
size and weight than desktop disks), and (2) information is modified by human
interaction using devices like **embedded keyboards** and **trackpads** --
though external mice and keyboards can be plugged in -- and then modified by the
computer using a **central processing unit (CPU)**.

While the behavior of laptops and desktops is almost identical, the actual components are generally specialized for laptops and cannot be easily interchanged with desktop components.

## Mobile Phones

The first **mobile phones** were computers in a much more limited sense than
desktops, laptops, and modern smart phones -- but nonetheless they could store
data like contacts, calendars, and even photos on small **memory cards**, as
well as, of course, carry out instructions like connecting to a phone line for
calling and texting.

**Smartphones** are much more similar to laptops and desktops than they are to
their predecessors in the type and complexity of their components, and in the
amount of data and processing power that enables them to install applications,
run operating systems, and much more.

![Two decades of evolution of mobile phones, from a 1992 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X to the 2014 iPhone 6 Plus. The change from tactile interfaces (buttons, nontouch screens) to touchscreens for interacting with data on a phone is visible. In addition, the ability to store large amounts of data, even entire operating systems, was introduced with the first "smartphones" of Blackberry and IPhone in the mid 2000s.

## Game consoles

Game consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, as well as handheld handheld
consoles like Nintendo Switch and Valve Steam Deck, are similar to smartphones
in that they technically contain all of the components of a computer, but
generally manufactured from **proprietary hardware** that cannot be interchanged
with other computers.

Video game consoles showed an interesting development in **storage technology**
in the elate 90's: originally, game data AND user save data would be stored on a
**writable** [ROM game cartridge] as in the N64 (left). The next generation of
systems like Gamecube (right) would provide **read-only** game data on a [CD-ROM
disk] with writable data being stored on a separate [memory card]. Images by

## Nonelectronics?

Even before there were consumer electronics, there were devices made to store
and process data -- that is, computers! The following are three different
examples of nonelectronic devices that have been used for computation.

## Computers within computers?

It is possible, and actually quite common, to create computers _inside_ other
computers, using the programming capabilities of that computer.

The above are just some of many devices that are computers in this sense.
Appliances like dishwashers/washing machines with cycle settings, handheld
electronics like calculators (whether programmable or not), wearables like
fitbits, fare gates and metro stops, traffic lights... these are just some of
the many devices that work based on computing principles.

## Digital computers

You may think the above definition is _too_ general -- indeed, in the context of
this class, we will almost always be talking specifically about **digital**
computers when we say _computer_. What is the difference?

Digital computers have the following two additional properties compared to
general computers. They are:

- **Digital**: All the "information" stored is represented by combinations of
  two different states (0 or 1, i.e., ON or OFF).[^digital]
- **Deterministic**: A given input reliably produces a defined output with every
  interaction.[^deterministic]

When we study the components of computers, the above two properties will allow
us to really understand _how_ such devices work and why, as in every case, the
device implements these two properties to give us the behavior we need.

[^digital]:
    These digital states are made possible using electrical circuitry. In order
    to do complex operations with these states, we can use the **binary**
    numbering to represent the digital states as a variety of numbers, letters,
    and other concepts. This digital information can be shared between devices
    using cables (whether electrical or optical, as we will see)

[^deterministic]:
    For one e.g., when you tap your OPUS card on a fare gate, you should expect
    that it will either let you through (if you have fare) or not (if you
    don't). The concept is more general: computer engineering is, in part, the
    study and practise of making physical interactions with computing devices
    **reliably and predictably** produce the same _deterministic_ results under
    the same physical conditions.

## Hardware vs Software

**Hardware**: The **physical** components that make up a computer system.

**Software**: The **programs** (instructions) that tell the computer (the
hardware) what to do.

## Personal vs shared computing: What is a server?

In the beginning, our focus will be on understanding individual personal
computers. Yet, this barely scratches the surface of how computers are used in
modern society -- we will also need to learn about how many computers can be
combined to pool resources and provide services at all times of day, as this is
essential to the infrastructure of the internet and a foundational concept in
technical support as a profession.

For now, we can just know that **servers** are similar to personal computers,
but use specialized hardware that is optimized for being turned on 24/7, for
communicating with other servers, and for processing and managing **large**
amounts of data.

This is because **servers** are the necessary infrastructure for running the
large popular websites and services many of us use today on a regular basis:
Social Media websites like Facebook/Instragram/etc., educational resources like
Omnivox/Moodle, online software like Office 365, etc. all run on **servers**, or
on collections of servers, known as **server farms**.

- Are video game consoles computers?
- Are there examples of nonelectonic computers? How do nonelectronic computer
  _compute_?
- Why is **binary** relevant to computers?
- What is the property of computers that means they reliably behave the same way
  given the same input?

  specialized for processing large amounts of data and pooling many computing
  resources in one place?

## Additional resources

This section contains helpful links to related content. You aren't required to
study these in detail, but it never hurts to learn more.

- [Computer Basics by GCF Global](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/):
  We will eventually cover almost all of the material in this free online
  resource; for now, **Parts 1-7** in particular are relevant to what we have
  learned so far.
- ["The Mother of All Demos"](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/209/448/)
  This is a 1968 presentation that introduced many of the hardware/graphics
  concepts we will see today and some we will see in future lectures: the mouse,
  networking, video conferencing, word documents, hyperlinks, _gamer
  headphones_, etc. It is very cool to see the palpable excitement of the 2000+
  audience tuning into a passionate presentation of a series of completely new
  technologies.
- Montréal's [Musée de l'Ordinateur](http://emusee.org/) -- unfortunately the
  physical location has been closed since 2022, but the website is still a neat
  resource for reading on the history of personal computers and their evolution.
  The author's bias towards Bill Gates and Windows machines is quite strong
  (there is _much_ more to the story), but the information provided is reliable
  and interesting.
