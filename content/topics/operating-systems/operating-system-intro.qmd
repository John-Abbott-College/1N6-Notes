# What's an operating sytem?
The operating system (OS) is the main software that controls a computer‚Äôs hardware, manages the file system, and runs applications. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the computer without writing binary code for the CPU.

The OS is always active and is the first program loaded into memory when the computer starts. All other applications operate within it, while the OS handles memory and process allocation for each one. It also manages input and output operations and switches efficiently between different tasks.

## Loading the boot loader

As we've seen in the hardware module, the firmware of the motherboard, the BIOS (or UEFI) is responsible for "waking up" the hardware and loading the operating system. The BIOS/UEFI looks for a bootable device based on the **boot order**. The first boot device in the list should have a "boot sector" in which the "boot loader", a special software is located, will load the OS into memory. This process will follow the __legacy__ MBR parition style or the more modern **UEFI** GPT partition style.

- **MBR**: In legacy systems, the BIOS looks for the __Master Boot Record (MBR)__ located on the first sector of the boot disk. MBR has limitations which we will cover later.

- **GPT** : In modern systems, the UEFI uses the __GUID Partition Table__ instead 

# History of OS
We've marked a few key events in the history of operating systems. Try to organize them in chronological order:

# Windows ü™ü

## The days of MS-DOS
If we‚Äôre going to discuss Windows, it‚Äôs important to mention its predecessor: MS-DOS. This was a command-line‚Äìonly operating system developed for x86 systems (based on the Intel 8088 CPU architecture). It was originally created by Tim Paterson at Seattle Computer Products. In 1981, Microsoft acquired the company, hired Paterson, and adapted the system for its own personal computers‚Äîrebranding it as MS-DOS.

Most MS-DOS commands are still supported by Windows Command Prompt __CMD__.

## Windows over the years

# Windows 9
**What happened to Windows 9?**
It Never came out! Some believe this was a Marketing strategy to signify that Windows 10 is the **last major version of Windows** and it‚Äôs a **"revolutionary version"**. In the end, it wasn't revolution,and was certainly not the last Windows version.

## Windows 11

The latest version of Windows is Windows 11. These are the important features:

- **UEFI** Firmware Required: Windows 11 only supports motherboards with UEFI; legacy BIOS systems are not compatible.

- **Secure Boot**: Must be enabled in the system firmware.

- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: Version 2.0 or higher is required for installation.

- **Zero Trust Compatibility**: All users, processes, and services must be verified and trusted at every level of the system.

- **Internet Connection**: Needed during setup to complete installation and sign in with a Microsoft account. 
üëâ Actually, there is a way to bypass to those setup steps. More on this during the lab.

- **Other features**: All editions except the Home ed, come with BitLocker and OneDrive for Business. BitLocker gives the ability to encrypt the storage device to prevent information theft. OneDrive allows for file synchronization to the cloud.  

## Windows 11: System requirements

- **RAM** : 4Gb Minimum 
- **CPU** : 1Ghz, 2 Cores


## Windows CMD Commands
These commands will be explored in this course. 

- `cd` : Changes the current directory
- `echo`: writes input text to a standard output (file or console)
- `dir`: short for directory, it prints out the current directory
- `del` : deletes a file 
- `copy`: creates a copy of a file and moves it elsewhere in the filesystem or to another device. In modern Windows, it can be used to concatenate files together or copy multiple files.
- `rename`: moves files or renames them. 


# Linux üêß

Linux is built on the Unix operating system and is both free and open source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it.

There are many Linux distributions, which are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel and bundled with additional software for specific purposes. Some are used for servers. Here are some popular examples:

- Fedora ‚Äì Popular among developers

- Ubuntu ‚Äì Great choice for beginners

- Debian

- Solus

- Deepin

- Linux Mint

## Unix vs Linux

For beginners, Unix and Linux are often confusing. Unix was developed in the 1960s by AT&T and served as the foundation for many modern operating systems, including macOS and Linux. You could compare Unix to Linux in the same way MS-DOS relates to Windows; both laid the groundwork for more advanced systems. However, there is one key difference: Linux was written entirely from scratch by Linus Torvalds, though it was designed to follow the Unix architecture.

## Linux Commands

Linux commands are fundamental tools used in the command line interface (CLI) to interact with the operating system. Common examples include:

`ls` : Lists contents of directories
`cd` : Changes the current directory
`pwd` : Displays the current directory path
`mkdir`: Creates a new directory
`touch`: Creates a file
`cat`: Concatenates and displays the content of files. 
`echo`: Prints out a given string to a standard output (terminal or file)
`cp`, `mv`, `rm` : Used to copy, move, and delete files respectively

`sudo` : Executes commands with administrative (root) privileges
`free` : Shows memory usage
`df` : Checks disk space usage
`top` : Monitors running processes

# Mac OS üçè

Although macOS is also a Unix-based operating system, it is a proprietary platform developed by Apple and closely integrated with Apple hardware. Developed in the 1980s, it is well-known for its user-friendly design and optimized experience for professional users. This course will not focus on macOS; however, most Linux commands still apply since both systems share Unix roots. You are encouraged to explore the Mac computers in P-322 and become familiar with this operating system because this will come in handy for future courses.

# Chrome 

This OS was designed by Google around the 2010s. It's a Linux kernel- based and derived from the free software Chromium OS. Chrome OS uses Google Chrome as the main interface allowing users to only use Web Apps. 
This course will not focus on Chrome OS.

# Server Operating Systems

These are designed for corporate environment servicing multiple users with a wide range of needs. They generally provide network resources including server applications, centralized data storage, network print queues, RAID and backup systems.

# Mobile Operating systems

Mobile devices such as Smart phones and tablets have their own light weight operating systems. They manage the specific hardware of mobile devices, provide network connectivity, and intuitive user experience. There exist many mobile operating systems, but the most popular ones are **Android** developed by Google and **iOS** developed by Apple:

Other operating systems:

- Harmony OS (Huawei)

- Tizen (Samsung)

- Windows mobile (Microsoft)

- WebOS
