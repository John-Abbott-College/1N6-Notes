Unforunately I am not feeling well today and would like to make sure I do not pass that along to you -- I will be cancelling today's class. 

I will be uploading today's lecture notes shortly. The link for these will appear on LEA soon. **Please read them in advance of Thursday's class, where we will be doing in-class activities based on some of the content**.

You can also see all of the content we've covered the past two days on the [course calendar][calendar].

Let me know if you have any questions!
